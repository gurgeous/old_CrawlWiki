This guide covers "Conjurers", a term that encompasses all characters who kill almost exclusively with Conjuration spells, but do not necessarily or usually start with the Conjurer background.
</p><p>The Conjurer is arguably the most powerful type of character, becoming easy after a sometimes hard early game, and in particular is the most suitable in the endgame for raiding <a href="/Ziggurat" title="Ziggurat">ziggurats</a> due to the ability to cast <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a>/<a href="/Ice_Storm" title="Ice Storm">Ice Storm</a> at maximum success rate and power, with no grinding to raise spell skills beforehand.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Species">Species</span></h2>
<p>Your choice of species will have a significant impact on your conjurer's skillset and survivability.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Deep_Elf">Deep Elf</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Deep_Elf" title="Deep Elf">Deep Elves</a> are the most powerful and versatile spellcasters in the game. However, they are also very fragile, and usually need to be played quite carefully and slowly to avoid stupid deaths.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="High_Elf">High Elf</span></h3>
<p><a href="/High_Elves" title="High Elves" class="mw-redirect">High Elves</a> are a bit less capable as spellcasters, but more well-rounded, and might be the most suitable for a beginner, or for a hybrid playstyle. Should you decide to hybridize your High Elf, grab a long blade and a buckler (and hopefully later a shield) and invest in air magic (second highest aptitude in the game) for its support magic and eventually to unleash Tornado upon your foes!
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Naga">Naga</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Naga" title="Naga">Nagas</a> are average spellcasters, similar to humans, but they are a high HP race with a fantastic aptitude for Stealth, decent Fighting, intrinsic poison resistance, see invisible, and a poison spit that is quite helpful in the early game. Furthermore, they can wear naga bardings which provide +8 AC compared to boots once fully enchanted, and get +9 AC naturally, all without needing to train Armour skill.
</p><p>Naga conjurers are among the most popular endgame characters, and arguably the best except for lucky <a href="/Demonspawn" title="Demonspawn">Demonspawn</a> mutations or shuffled <a href="/Troll" title="Troll">Trolls</a>.
</p><p>The disadvantage is that nagas are slow and have bad Dodging aptitude. The slowness, however, is only a problem in the beginning because <a href="/Spider_Form" title="Spider Form">Spider Form</a>, semi-controlled Blink and <a href="/Swiftness" title="Swiftness">Swiftness</a>+<a href="/Flight" title="Flight">Flight</a> make it much less relevant once you get them. In the early game, the poison spit is quite powerful and compensates for their slowness.
</p><p>Nagas should focus Fire magic since they don't need the AC from Ozocubu's Armor and benefit more from Conjure Flame to block corridors due to their slowness. Wizard is the best background due to guaranteed access to Blink (more useful for nagas who need escape abilities) and Mephitic Cloud (intrinsic poison resistance allows them to target themselves). Venom Mage is also popular, but you lose access to Blink, only have access to poison-based spells instead of poison + fire. With the nerf to Poison Arrow in 0.6, poison magic is not very useful late-game.
</p><p>In the early game, make sure to first attack with the poison spit, and then follow with conjurations if you face a tough monster. You can use the poison spit somewhat liberally, despite the hunger cost, but spitting on every enemy that crosses your path will wreak havoc with your satiation.
</p><p>Remember that while it is a good idea to retreat in corridors, you cannot run away from anything until you get the aforementioned ways to compensate for slowness. However, you can move away so that the enemies attack less frequently, while your poison spit and MP recharge.
</p><p>For examples on how to win naga conjurers, see the following games:

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Demonspawn">Demonspawn</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Demonspawn" title="Demonspawn">Demonspawn</a> are not particularly good as spellcasters, but they are usable as such, and have interesting, extremely random mutations that can swing the balance in their favor hugely.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Draconian">Draconian</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Draconian" title="Draconian">Draconians</a> are not particularly good as general spellcasters, but their color will make them proficient in some areas. Red and purple draconians are probably the best conjurers.
</p><p>Since you won't know your draconian's color at the start of the game, you need to either quit undesirable colors, or play them with a much more flexible approach.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tengu">Tengu</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Tengu" title="Tengu">Tengus</a> are skilled in <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a>, good at <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a> and <a href="/Air_Magic" title="Air Magic">Air Magic</a>, and their flight intrinsic can help them escape danger (or simply boost their EV) throughout the game. They also have good aptitudes for Fighting and Unarmed Combat that can supplement their use of conjurations. On the flip side, they are as fragile as deep elfs, not as versatile in the magic department, and they cannot wear boots.
</p><p>Their best backgrounds are Wizard, Conjurer (fire), Fire Elementalist or Air Elementalist. Wizards are probably the best due to access to Blink and Mephitic Cloud, but make sure you train Conjurations immediately (see Skills strategy below) or you won't have enough power to kill monsters.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Kobolds">Kobolds</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Kobold" title="Kobold">Kobolds</a> are a surprisingly good race for Conjurers. They have mediocre aptitudes on most schools, but are carnivores and thus hunger is much less of an issue. They are good at Dodging and are small, which improves Evasion and Stealth.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Merfolk">Merfolk</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Merfolk" title="Merfolk">Merfolks</a> are among the best Ice conjurers, relying more on their good <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a> aptitude than their somewhat bad <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> aptitude. Merfolks are best played as Wizards, Conjurers (ice) or Ice Elementalists.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Human">Human</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Human" title="Human">Humans</a> are not particularly good as spellcasters, but are well-rounded and level quickly, granting extra spell levels.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Demigod">Demigod</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Demigod" title="Demigod">Demigods</a> are not particularly good as spellcasters, and the lack of a god will hinder them. On the bright side their high HP/MP and attributes might let you compensate that.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Vampire">Vampire</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Vampire" title="Vampire">Vampires</a> are very bad at <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a>, but average at <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a> and <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a>, and good at <a href="/Charms" title="Charms">Charms</a>. They also benefit from a lenient food clock, have an intrinsic escape ability (Bat Form), and great synergy with the <a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> spell, since they can bottle blood from corpses. Playing the food clock properly is key; worshipping Kikubaaqudgha for his corpse delivery is also a good idea.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mummy">Mummy</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Mummy" title="Mummy">Mummies</a> are bad at everything save for <a href="/Necromancy" title="Necromancy">Necromancy</a> and <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a>, but they are foodless, allowing them to ignore spell hunger. However, any other race is flat-out better than a <a href="/Mummy" title="Mummy">Mummy</a> when using the <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> spell. Still, for the cautious, prudent player who wants permanent undead status without relying on chance, Mummies are an option.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sludge_Elf">Sludge Elf</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Sludge_Elf" title="Sludge Elf">Sludge Elves</a> have a mediocre aptitude for conjurations and are generally better played as transmuters, but can be decent in this role, due to their +2 aptitude in <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a>. Sludge elves will especially find themselves at home using earth magic as many of its spells are dual school with Transmutations, and some of its most destructive spells (such as Lee's Rapid Deconstruction and Shatter) do not even use the Conjurations skill at all!
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Troll_.28advanced.29">Troll (advanced)</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Troll" title="Troll">Trolls</a> are the worst race in all spellcasting skills (except Earth Magic, where they are less bad), but they have huge HP and Strength, which can be switched to Intelligence using a Shuffle card (normally done by worshipping <a href="/Nemelex_Xobeh" title="Nemelex Xobeh">Nemelex Xobeh</a>). While this process will produce one of the best characters possible, it is rather tedious and hard.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fire_vs_Ice_Magic">Fire vs Ice Magic</span></h2>
<p>An essential choice is whether you want to use and train Fire or Ice magic. Air magic and Earth magic got significant buffs in 0.8, but their end-game viability has yet to be determined.
</p><p>If your species has higher aptitude in one of them, you should pick accordingly (Merfolk, White Draconian, Vampire -&gt; Ice; Tengu, Demonspawn, Mottled Draconian, Pale Draconian, Red Draconian -&gt; Fire). If aptitudes are equal, then Fire Magic is generally accepted as the better choice, though before the endgame Ice and Fire are somewhat tied.
</p><p>Overall, Fire magic is more offensive, with arguably the most powerful conjuration in the game, <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a>, and a guaranteed spell enhancer (<a href="/Ring_of_Flames" title="Ring of Flames">Ring of Flames</a>) to boost its power. The undead are also not resistant to Fire magic, which means you won't have to train Necromancy very high or use spell levels for Dispel Undead.
</p><p>Ice magic does have its advantages. Ice Storm can technically deal more damage to cold-resistant monsters than Fire Storm to fire-resistant monsters (since Fire Storm is 35% resistible versus Ice Storm's 25%), and the several buffs you can get from the midgame on (<a href="/Ozocubu%27s_Armour" title="Ozocubu's Armour">Ozocubu's Armour</a>, <a href="/Condensation_Shield" title="Condensation Shield">Condensation Shield</a>, and <a href="/Ice_Form" title="Ice Form">Ice Form</a>) do tend to make Ice conjurers slightly tougher. In the end, your aptitudes should be the major deciding factor.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Backgrounds">Backgrounds</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Wizard"><a href="/Wizard" title="Wizard">Wizard</a></span></h3>
<p>This is the background you should generally choose, especially if you worship Sif Muna, since it offers all the useful early game spells except Swiftness (Blink, Mephitic Cloud, Magic Dart, and Conjure Flame), and you are guaranteed to be gifted all spells, so higher level spells are usually not a problem.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Conjurer"><a href="/Conjurer" title="Conjurer">Conjurer</a></span></h3>
<p>This background is somewhat similar to the elementalists, but starts with a different book and a higher skill in Conjurations instead of the elemental skill. It gives you a book gifted by Vehumet, which means you will get Power and Annihilations earlier, but will have one less guaranteed book.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Conjurer_.28fire.2Bearth.29">Conjurer (fire+earth)</span></h4>
<p>The Fire version compared to Fire Elementalist has Bolt of Magma instead of Bolt of Fire, which is usually worse. It is good for Tengu who have an easier early game due to the higher conjurations aptitude and thus higher spell power for Conjuration/Fire spells, and get Mystic Blast earlier which is good for them due to the high Conjurations skill.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Conjurer_.28ice.2Bair.29">Conjurer (ice+air)</span></h4>
<p>The Ice version features Mephitic Cloud and Freezing Cloud but lacks Ozocubu's Armor, Ensorcelled Hibernation, Condensation Shield, Ozocubu's Refrigeration, Simulacrum and Metabolic Englaciation.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fire_Elementalist"><a href="/Fire_Elementalist" title="Fire Elementalist">Fire Elementalist</a></span></h3>
<p>This background starts with all spells in the elemental school, and elemental skill. This means that you don't get Blink or Mephitic Cloud, which increases early game risk. However, you get more powerful spells such as Sticky Flame and Bolt of Fire for Fire Elementalists.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ice_Elementalist"><a href="/Ice_Elementalist" title="Ice Elementalist">Ice Elementalist</a></span></h3>
<p>This background starts with all spells in the elemental school, and elemental skill. This means that you don't get Blink or Mephitic Cloud, which increases early game risk. You do however get Ozocubu's Armor. Furthermore, compared to Conjurers (ice), you get Throw Icicle (partially irresistible) but lose Bolt of Cold.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Air_Elementalist"><a href="/Air_Elementalist" title="Air Elementalist">Air Elementalist</a></span></h3>
<p>The Air Elementalist starts with Swiftness, which is otherwise relatively rare, and Mephitic Cloud, both good spells to avoid risks. You will however lack Fire/Ice conjurations at first.
</p><p>Air Elementalists require a different technique with Shock than other conjurers. In particular, <a href="/Shock" title="Shock">Shock</a> and <a href="/Lightning_Bolt" title="Lightning Bolt">Lightning Bolt</a> bounce, and it is thus important to zap the enemies two times ("bizap") or even better three times ("trizap"). See the <a href="/Multizap" title="Multizap">Multizap</a> article for how to perform this.
</p><p><a href="/Tornado" title="Tornado">Tornado</a> is now a reasonable contender for the <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a>/<a href="/Ice_Storm" title="Ice Storm">Ice Storm</a> slot in a Conjurer's arsenal.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Earth_Elementalist"><a href="/Earth_Elementalist" title="Earth Elementalist">Earth Elementalist</a></span></h3>
<p>Earth magic got a massive buff in 0.8 and is now a great choice for species that usually see little action as conjurers, such as sludge elves (good staff of earth and <a href="/Statue_Form" title="Statue Form">Statue Form</a> users), Deep Dwarves (who have the highest Earth magic aptitudes in the game), and even Ghouls (though you will have to work around a low starting Int). Earth magic has many of its best spells as single school (now including Shatter) or paired with Transmutations (which allows you to work towards Necromuation) as unique support spells. Good gods for earth elementalists include Cheibriados for stat boosts coupled with Statue Form, Ashenzari for accurate LRD aiming and reskill for a staff of earth, Vehumet for his low-management boosts and books, and Makhleb for his healing and demonic summons, which are especially good for Ghouls and Deep Dwarves.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Venom_Mage"><a href="/Venom_Mage" title="Venom Mage">Venom Mage</a></span></h3>
<p>Venom Mage starts with Mephitic Cloud, Sting, Poison Weapon and Cure Poison. Due to the nerf to Poison Arrow in 0.6, poison magic is less useful late-game, and it is often better to start as a Wizard, still getting Mephitic Cloud, but also Blink and fire/ice spells.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Necromancer"><a href="/Necromancer" title="Necromancer">Necromancer</a></span></h3>
<p>The Necromancer is a bit different from the other backgrounds: it starts with an attack spell as usual (Pain), but also has HP gain spells (Regeneration, Vampiric Draining) and reanimation spells (Animate Skeleton and Animate Dead), giving you permanent allies who can't leave the level. They also have Dispel Undead which is awesome against undead and in the Crypt.
</p><p>They demand a somewhat different playing style (generally more melee oriented) due to their spell set. Most if not all of the Necromancer's spells have no effect on late-game demons, so melee skills or a high-powered conjuration skill is recommended. Kikubaaqudgha can be an option for them instead of Sif Muna/Vehumet.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gods">Gods</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sif_Muna">Sif Muna</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Sif_Muna" title="Sif Muna">Sif Muna</a> is the default god for conjurers: her features will result in a smooth low-risk game (which you may however find somewhat boring).
</p><p>You will have:
</p>
<ul><li>Spellbook gifts depending on spell skills and spell success. You should train skills to influence this appropriately, which will make the game more predictable. You will get every spell in the game via gifts.
</li><li>MP channeling: this is quite powerful, since it is a very reliable method of regaining MP no matter what. It does require training <a href="/Invocations" title="Invocations">Invocations</a>, unfortunately, a problem for species with a bad aptitude (such as <a href="/Vampires" title="Vampires" class="mw-redirect">Vampires</a>).
</li><li>Miscast protection: nice, but not really essential
</li><li>Forget Spell: this is useful in the beginning when you haven't found <a href="/Scroll_of_amnesia" title="Scroll of amnesia">scrolls of amnesia</a>. Don't overuse this, since the piety cost will result in fewer gifts.
</li></ul>
<p>Sif Muna is excellent at first; her usefulness will drop as the game advances, and you will only care about the MP channeling in the endgame - but by that time, other methods and gods become competitive, and even surpassing Sif Muna's ability. However, Sif Muna is good enough to clear Ziggurats, despite some difficulty, and possibly with significant trouble if you get particularly unlucky.
</p><p>If you decide to drop Sif Muna, be aware that her induced miscasts no longer have a chance to reduce penance.  Don't even consider it if you don't have access to mutation resistance and 2+ potions of cure mutation since you will spend a lot of time <a href="/Glow" title="Glow">glowing</a>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Vehumet">Vehumet</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Vehumet" title="Vehumet">Vehumet</a> will enhance conjurations and summoning, but at the expense of a riskier game, especially at first. However, your conjurations will be better, you will get Fire/Ice Storm earlier, and Vehumet's MP-for-kills will shine with it.
</p><p>You will have:
</p>
<ul><li>Fixed book gifts. These guarantee powerful conjurations early (especially Mystic Blast)
</li><li>Gain MP on kills (1 + HD/4 on average with (piety - 30)/piety chance or 85% at full piety)
</li><li>Conjurations with MP cost of at least 5 will cost 1 MP less
</li><li>The range of conjurations is extended by 1. This is good for Mystic Blast, Iron Shot and Crystal Spear, and awesome for Fire/Ice Storm to hit things out of LOS.
</li><li>Wizardry bonus for conjurations. You will learn those powerful spells earlier and be able to cast them better.
</li></ul>
<p>Thanks to the MP on the kills, and the extended and cheaper Fire Storm, Vehumet is somewhat better than Sif Muna in the endgame and Ziggurats. However, the lack of spell versatility means you must be on the lookout for books that contain other spells you need and spend gold/scrolls of acquirement to obtain them.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Kikubaaqudgha">Kikubaaqudgha</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Kikubaaqudgha" title="Kikubaaqudgha">Kikubaaqudgha</a> is a god focusing on Necromancy. In general, you will have:
</p>
<ul><li>MP via corpses: corpse delivery can be used in conjunction with <a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> to obtain a very efficient way of channeling MP, which is even faster than Sif Muna's. However, unlike Sif Muna, this will cost some piety.
</li><li>Undead servants, by animating the corpses
</li><li>Protection from mummy curses
</li></ul>
<p>If/when you use lich form, you get:
</p>
<ul><li>Gifts the Necronomicon with Necromutation at full piety
</li><li>Torment while immune
</li></ul>
<p>If/when you do not use lich form, you get:
</p>
<ul><li>Torment protection: this is nice and unlike lich form, allows to cast <a href="/Regeneration" title="Regeneration">Regeneration</a> and <a href="/Borgnjor%27s_Revivification" title="Borgnjor's Revivification">Borgnjor's Revivification</a>
</li><li>Better Death's Door: 26 HP instead of 13 HP. This is probably not too significant (you can die anyway).
</li><li>Torment while protected
</li></ul>
<p>Kiku offers better (but harder to manage) MP regeneration than Sif Muna thanks to the <a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> spell, found in the first book he gifts; his corpse delivery allows you to rely on it even in the endgame or in corpse-less branches, where his torment protection will also be quite useful. In addition, he will gift all the necromancy spells, including <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> and will help you in the early games with corpses you can use as weapons with <a href="/Corpse_Rot" title="Corpse Rot">Corpse Rot</a> or that can be animated.
</p><p>Torment can be used either alone, in lich form (Symbol of Torment is unavailable here), or with <a href="/Death%27s_Door" title="Death's Door">Death's Door</a> for interesting LOS-wide effects. Along with <a href="/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration" title="Ozocubu's Refrigeration">Ozocubu's Refrigeration</a>, this can potentially kill a large number of enemies at once.
</p><p>Note that tormenting with <a href="/Death%27s_Door" title="Death's Door">Death's Door</a> is risky due to the low HP (but Kiku reduces this), and otherwise you will likely be attacked a lot by the time you manage to collect a lot of monsters in LOS. However, the brave can cast <a href="/Death%27s_Door" title="Death's Door">Death's Door</a>, then <a href="/Controlled_Blink" title="Controlled Blink">Controlled Blink</a> in the middle of enemies, torment a few times, and kill everything living with <a href="/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration" title="Ozocubu's Refrigeration">Ozocubu's Refrigeration</a>. Not for the faint of heart!
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Makhleb">Makhleb</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Makhleb" title="Makhleb">Makhleb</a> is an unusual choice. He provides HP on kills (which can be converted to MP with <a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a>, especially if you're a high HP species like a naga). While he lacks specific spell enhancement features, the HP on kills can make it competitive with Vehumet in clearing Ziggurats, and he is thus possibly a better choice if you start with another playstyle and switch to this one later in the game.
</p><p>If you decide to take him up early, the conjuration and summoning invocations can also be used, but he will probably be overall inferior to the magic focused gods.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Shining_One">The Shining One</span></h3>
<p><a href="/The_Shining_One" title="The Shining One">The Shining One</a> can serve a similar role as Makhleb, since he provides the same HP and MP on kills, but only for undead and demon kills (which are, however, the majority of the end game and all the hard Ziggurat floors, except the holy ones, which are peaceful with TSO). In addition, he gives you rN+++, divine warriors, and an accuracy enhancing halo. However, he forbids the use of Poison Magic and Necromancy (including Regeneration).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cheibriados">Cheibriados</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Cheibriados" title="Cheibriados">Cheibriados</a> offers a bonus to stats (+15 with 5 ponderous items), of which the +15 to intelligence and to dexterity are quite interesting. The ponderousness has little impact, since you can use semicontrolled or controlled blinking to get away from bad situations; the real downside of Cheibriados is the lack of MP regeneration and book gifts, and the inability to cast <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a>. In addition, being required to wear ponderous armor to gain Cheibriados' bonuses can conflict with the useful attributes of many <a href="/Randarts" title="Randarts" class="mw-redirect">randarts</a> and <a href="/Artifacts" title="Artifacts" class="mw-redirect">artifacts</a>.
</p><p>Note that intelligence 34 and 3 enhancers is good enough to cast Fire/Ice Storm at maximum power, so the effect of Cheibriados is essentially to save an equipment slot, since with 35+15 intelligence, only 2 enhancers are necessary. Thus, Cheibriados is inferior in this aspect, since casting <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> and having good MP regen with another god is often much more useful than one equipment slot. However, for users of Earth or Air magic, there are no enhancer rings, and Cheibriados can in this case allow more spell power than any other choice.
</p><p>In addition to the bonuses above, Cheibriados offers Step out of Time, which can be useful for saving yourself, and Slouch, which can potentially complement the damage for your conjurations, damaging in particular fast enemies, which are the most likely to be able to melee you and cause trouble (Executioners are the best example).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ashenzari">Ashenzari</span></h3>
<p>Similar to Cheibriados, <a href="/Ashenzari" title="Ashenzari">the god of divinations</a> lacks a way of letting you regen MP, but grants multiple side benefits that endgame characters might enjoy. The bonus XP and ability to transfer XP from one skill to another greatly increase your versatility, and his information-gathering powers can let you avoid tough battles before you're ready for them. And free identify for everything isn't too shabby either.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_strategy">Skills strategy</span></h2>
<p>In general, you will want to raise your Spellcasting when you need more spell slots or MP, and otherwise raise the skills to get your next spells at usable success rates and influence Sif Muna gifts (see the section below for details). Disable all the spell skills you don't want to train but are frequently using.
</p><p>At XL 1, you should probably disable all spell skills except Spellcasting, especially for backgrounds and species who start with a low skill. If you're playing a Wizard, however, you'll probably want to disable everything but Conjurations to improve your Magic Dart's power.
</p><p>Maximum HP depends on both experience level and <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a> skill, so you will also want to raise <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a> to at least skill 5 (start with plants and rats in Lair if you are a fragile race bad at melee). You will want to keep your weapon skill and <a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a> always disabled unless you actually want to use melee in real combat. Train with the weapon you have the most aptitude in (and choose one with high to-hit). If you are a <a href="/Tengu" title="Tengu">Tengu</a> or <a href="/Minotaur" title="Minotaur">Minotaur</a> (the only races with an aptitude for <a href="/Staves" title="Staves">Staves</a>), consider using an elemental magical staff.
</p><p><a href="/Dodging" title="Dodging">Dodging</a> and <a href="/Armour" title="Armour">Armour</a> should be always left enabled. <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a> should be left enabled at first and may be disabled at around 10-15 or once you start using noisy spells such as <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a> regularly.
</p><p>If worshiping Sif Muna, <a href="/Invocations" title="Invocations">Invocations</a> skills determines how much mana you get per channeling, and only multiples of 4 matter: you should raise it to 4 or 8 and then disable it.
You will use channeling so frequently (and immediately after battle with full XP pools) that it will raise a lot even if disabled.
If you want to use a crystal ball of energy, you will want to train <a href="/Evocations" title="Evocations">Evocations</a> as high as possible using a staff of channeling. Keep it always enabled in that case, or until it reaches something like 10 otherwise.
</p><p>Keep ranged fighting skills disabled, don't use them (and usually don't even get them), since you use <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> for ranged attacks.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_school.2Felemental_skills_strategy_and_the_critical_spells">Spell school/elemental skills strategy and the critical spells</span></h3>
<p>The main objective of conjurers in the game is to raise their spellcasting skills to be able cast the spells they want at the success rate they want.
Sif Muna followers also need to raise skills to influence god gifts to get those spells are early as possible.
</p><p>There is a set of high level spells that are highly desirable, whose acquisition will be your objective for most of the game and will drive most of your skill training.
The skill levels are very approximate, since intelligence, whether you choose to permanently wear a ring of wizardry, and whether you worship Vehumet alter this.
The ones shown are appropriate for a non-Vehumet character of intelligence 25 with no wizardry bonus.
</p><p>Spells below level 5 are not included, since it is generally easy to be able to cast them, and they often depend on the background chosen. Also, it is assumed that Spellcasting is equal to the spell skill.
</p><p>These are the critical spells for conjurers:
</p>
<ul><li>L5 <a href="/Ozocubu%27s_Refrigeration" title="Ozocubu's Refrigeration">Ozocubu's Refrigeration</a> at Great for ice conjurers: 8 in <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a>. Just cast your normal ice conjurations with Conjurations disabled to get this.
</li><li>L6 <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> at Great: 11 in <a href="/Charms" title="Charms">Charms</a>. Victory dance with <a href="/Swiftness" title="Swiftness">Swiftness</a> (keep Air Magic disabled) to get this.
</li><li>L6 <a href="/Deflect_Missiles" title="Deflect Missiles">Deflect Missiles</a> at Good: 9 in <a href="/Charms" title="Charms">Charms</a> and <a href="/Air_Magic" title="Air Magic">Air Magic</a>. Victory dance with <a href="/Swiftness" title="Swiftness">Swiftness</a> to get this.
</li><li>L6 <a href="/Bolt_of_Cold" title="Bolt of Cold">Bolt of Cold</a>/<a href="/Bolt_of_Fire" title="Bolt of Fire">Bolt of Fire</a>/<a href="/Fireball" title="Fireball">Fireball</a>/<a href="/Freezing_Cloud" title="Freezing Cloud">Freezing Cloud</a> at Great: 11 in <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> and <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a>/<a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a>. Just cast your normal conjurations to get this.
</li><li>L7 <a href="/Controlled_Blink" title="Controlled Blink">Controlled Blink</a> at Great: 14 in <a href="/Translocation" title="Translocation" class="mw-redirect">Translocation</a>. Victory dance with <a href="/Phase_Shift" title="Phase Shift">Phase Shift</a> if you have it or with <a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a> in a cleared space, with no teleport control to avoid glow, to get this.
</li><li>L8 <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> at Fair unenhanced: 15 in  <a href="/Transmutations" title="Transmutations">Transmutations</a> and <a href="/Necromancy" title="Necromancy">Necromancy</a>. Victory dance with <a href="/Pain" title="Pain">Pain</a> and <a href="/Sticks_to_Snakes" title="Sticks to Snakes">Sticks to Snakes</a>, then <a href="/Blade_Hands" title="Blade Hands">Blade Hands</a>, or by clearing <a href="/Crypt" title="Crypt" class="mw-redirect">Crypt</a> with <a href="/Dispel_Undead" title="Dispel Undead">Dispel Undead</a>.
</li><li>L8 <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> at Great unenhanced: 18 in  <a href="/Transmutations" title="Transmutations">Transmutations</a> and <a href="/Necromancy" title="Necromancy">Necromancy</a>.
</li><li>L9 <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a> or <a href="/Ice_Storm" title="Ice Storm">Ice Storm</a> at Very Good with ring of wizardry: 20 in <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> and <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a> or <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a>.
</li><li>L9 <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a> or <a href="/Ice_Storm" title="Ice Storm">Ice Storm</a> at Great unenhanced: 26 in <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> and <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a> or <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>Your objective in the game will be to raise skills for your starting spells and those you may find, and then:
</p>
<ul><li>Train Charms until you get Haste at Great
</li><li>Train Air Magic until you get Deflect Missiles at Good
</li><li>Train Conjurations and Fire Magic or Ice Magic until you get Bolt of Fire or Bolt of Cold at Great
</li><li>Train Translocations until you get Controlled Blink at Great
</li><li>Train Transmutations and Necromancy until you get Necromutation good enough for the wizardry enhancers you have
</li><li>Train Conjurations and Fire Magic until you maximize them for Fire Storm/Ice Storm
</li></ul>
<p>Summonings should be trained until around 5 to have <a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a> at sensible power (victory dance with <a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a> itself). If you need to get <a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a> from the book of Demonology, you will need to train Summonings to 10 (use <a href="/Summon_Small_Mammals" title="Summon Small Mammals" class="mw-redirect">Summon Small Mammals</a> or <a href="/Summon_Butterflies" title="Summon Butterflies">Summon Butterflies</a> to victory dance).
</p><p>Earth Magic and the one you don't use among Ice Magic and Fire Magic can be ignored. You may want to enhance <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a> in the extended endgame even if you are a fire conjurer for the <a href="/index.php?title=Ozocubu%27s_Armor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ozocubu's Armor (page does not exist)">Ozocubu's Armor</a> AC bonus, but this will be tedious.
</p><p>You may opt to get <a href="/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear" title="Lehudib's Crystal Spear">Lehudib's Crystal Spear</a>, in which case you will need Conjurations/Earth Magic at 18 to have it at Great unenhanced. Despite Crystal Spear's reputation as being extremely powerful, it is actually a rather mediocre spell, since Bolt of Fire/Cold have better range, hit chance and can hit multiple enemies, and Fire Storm/Ice Storm can be enhanced with rings of fire/ice, kill lots of enemies at once without missing, and tend to be better than <a href="/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear" title="Lehudib's Crystal Spear">Lehudib's Crystal Spear</a> even for single targets in the endgame. However, <a href="/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear" title="Lehudib's Crystal Spear">Lehudib's Crystal Spear</a> is unresistable, and is the most powerful non-noisy spell available. Your should probably only consider <a href="/Lehudib%27s_Crystal_Spear" title="Lehudib's Crystal Spear">Lehudib's Crystal Spear</a> if you are playing a <a href="/Deep_Elf" title="Deep Elf">Deep Elf</a> or another fragile race with awesome spell skill aptitudes who may get overwhelmed if they use <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a>/<a href="/Ice_Storm" title="Ice Storm">Ice Storm</a>, which tends to wake up all monsters in the vicinity.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fighting_strategy">Fighting strategy</span></h2>
<p>Generally, zap enemies with your most powerful conjuration until they die, channeling MP when you get low. If there are multiple enemies, try to either line them up for a beam spell, or bunch them up for an area spell. Dig can be useful to create a corridor to line monsters in. In the early and middle game you should always open fights with non-poison-resistant ranged attackers, casters, fast monsters, or groups of monsters with <a href="/Mephitic_Cloud" title="Mephitic Cloud">Mephitic Cloud</a>: this spell will often make the fight trivial since the enemy will be confused and will act randomly.
</p><p>If you want to run from a fast monster, Blink (semicontrolled or controlled if possible) to get some space and use <a href="/Conjure_Flame" title="Conjure Flame">Conjure Flame</a>, <a href="/Summon_Butterflies" title="Summon Butterflies">Summon Butterflies</a> or <a href="/Summon_Small_Mammals" title="Summon Small Mammals" class="mw-redirect">Summon Small Mammals</a> to block or delay it. Also use <a href="/Swiftness" title="Swiftness">Swiftness</a> (with <a href="/Flight" title="Flight">Flight</a> if needed) to run away. Don't forget to <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> before hard battles or if an apparently easy battle suddenly takes a turn for the worse.
</p><p>Use <a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a> to get rid of summons unless you have enough MP and success rate for <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a> or <a href="/Ice_Storm" title="Ice Storm">Ice Storm</a> (that will kill both the monster and the summons). Still, <a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a> is great in case you have very low MP and need to immediately get rid of summons (e.g. giant eyeballs summoned by Pan lords).
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Item_strategy">Item strategy</span></h2>
<p>If you find a ring of teleport control, wear it and keep it on permanently until you learn <a href="/Control_Teleport" title="Control Teleport">Control Teleport</a>: this will make the <a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a> spell perform a semicontrolled blink (a blink in a direction of your choice instead of completely randomly), which is extremely powerful, allowing you to escape easily from any situation. Note however that you will glow, so stop doing semicontrolled blinks as soon as you are out of trouble. Wear an amulet of resist mutation if you get to yellow Glow, to reduce your risk of mutating. An amulet of the gourmand, if applicable, will let you more or less ignore the hunger costs for your spells until you raise your Spellcasting and Int high enough.
</p><p>Magical staves are invaluable, so wield all staffs you find to identify them. You should wield a staff of conjurations or fire/ice unless you need to wear a randart weapon for resistances, or a staff of wizardry or energy: this will boost your spells. Staffs of energy should be used before casting <a href="/Flight" title="Flight">Flight</a>, <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> and <a href="/Deflect_Missiles" title="Deflect Missiles">Deflect Missiles</a> if they still have a hunger cost. Later on you may use a staff of enchantments instead to make them last longer. Staffs of channeling are useful in emergencies to get MP to cast emergency spells.
</p><p>You should generally try on all robes (maybe after casting detect curse) and wear a robe of resistance or of the Archmagi once you find it.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Acquirement_strategy">Acquirement strategy</span></h2>
<p>Spellbook acquirement if you don't worship Sif Muna. Staff acquirement if you haven't found a great staff yet. Otherwise, go for whatever you need -- gold for a treasure trove, armour if you haven't found boots yet, etc.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="MP_channeling_strategy">MP channeling strategy</span></h2>
<p>Since you will cast spells continuously and are worthless without them, recovering MP fast is a central problem.
</p><p>If you worship Sif Muna, just use the invocation. This will cost food, and you should thus wear an amulet of the gourmand if you have it. Getting <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> is extremely important, because once you are in lich form, you can channel MP for free (except for taking a turn to do it). You can also use the other methods, but they are not usually necessary, and they have downsides while the ability has none.
</p><p>Without Sif Muna, things are much more complex. You have several mechanisms available in this case, none of them perfect:
</p>
<ul><li>MP for kills, given by <a href="/Vehumet" title="Vehumet">Vehumet</a> and <a href="/The_Shining_One" title="The Shining One">The Shining One</a> (for demons and undead)
</li><li>MP for kills, given by demonspawn mutation
</li><li><a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> on wielded chunks from enemy corpses, corpses granted by Kikubaaquudgha, or potions of blood (Vampires)
</li><li><a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> on your own HP (non-fragile characters)
</li><li>Staff of channeling, which is however worse than the Sif Muna invocation, and needs a high <a href="/Evocations" title="Evocations">Evocations</a> skill to have a good chance of working
</li><li><a href="/Crystal_ball_of_energy" title="Crystal ball of energy">Crystal ball of energy</a>, which must be used when you have a certain minimum amount of HP and risks confusing you or setting your MP to zero (even with Evocations 27!)
</li><li><a href="/Potion_of_magic" title="Potion of magic">Potion of magic</a> in emergencies
</li><li>The <a href="/List_of_unrands#the_Staff_of_Wucad_Mu" title="List of unrands">Staff of Wucad Mu</a> in the unlikely event you find it
</li><li>Resting
</li></ul>
<p>Raising <a href="/Evocations" title="Evocations">Evocations</a> will be a priority in this case, especially for branches which lack corpses for <a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> (MP for kills will help a lot though). You should also have reliable escape mechanisms that don't need MP, such as scroll of blinking, scrolls or wands of teleportation, potions of speed or wand of hasting, and wand of digging. If you use a crystal ball of energy, keep potions of healing on hand to cure the potential confusion.
</p><p><b>Warning: do not use a crystal ball of energy in lich form</b>, unless you worship Lugonu or Nemelex Xobeh and have stacked legendary decks of Portal and Tomb. It can confuse you for enough turns to die (especially in Tartarus to Dispel Undead), and you will be totally helpless, since you can't cast spells, can't invoke abilities including End Transformation, can't drink potions, can't read scrolls, and can't use wands due to a random location offset. Worshipping Sif Muna is recommended, and avoids this issue.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_strategy">Spell strategy</span></h2>
<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of spells to keep on hand, depending on your skill, species, and equipment.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Miscellaneous_spells">Miscellaneous spells</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a>/<a href="/Controlled_Blink" title="Controlled Blink">Controlled Blink</a> to escape and avoid melee contact
</li><li><a href="/Slow" title="Slow">Slow</a> to slow down enemies resistant to poison but with low MR (especially snakes) in the early game
</li><li><a href="/Mephitic_Cloud" title="Mephitic Cloud">Mephitic Cloud</a> to disable enemies
</li><li><a href="/Conjure_Flame" title="Conjure Flame">Conjure Flame</a> to block corridors
</li><li><a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> to double your speed (causes glow, so don't abuse it unless you are in danger)
</li><li><a href="/Summon_Butterflies" title="Summon Butterflies">Summon Butterflies</a> (or <a href="/Summon_Small_Mammals" title="Summon Small Mammals" class="mw-redirect">Summon Small Mammals</a> if you don't have butterflies) to stop enemies from reaching you
</li><li><a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a> to get rid of summons immediately
</li><li><a href="/Dig" title="Dig">Dig</a> and <a href="/Teleport_Self" title="Teleport Self">Teleport Self</a> should be learned by fragile races with plenty of spell slots (so you can dig yourself in a tunnel, and also easily escape danger), whereas often a wand of digging and ring of teleportation are good enough for non-fragile races with fewer spell slots
</li><li><a href="/Apportation" title="Apportation">Apportation</a> if you want to minimize turn count, don't like to walk, or plan to take an extended vacation in the Abyss or Pandemonium
</li><li><a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a> to convert chunks or your own HP into MP (only do the latter on non-fragile classes with Fighting well trained)
</li><li><a href="/Spider_Form" title="Spider Form">Spider Form</a> for early/middle game nagas, or species who want an extra escape ability
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Occasionally_useful_spells">Occasionally useful spells</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction" title="Lee's Rapid Deconstruction">Lee's Rapid Deconstruction</a>/<a href="/Shatter" title="Shatter">Shatter</a> for stone vaults
</li><li><a href="/Alistair%27s_Intoxication" title="Alistair's Intoxication">Alistair's Intoxication</a> to guaranteedly confuse Vaults:8 guards, elves and Zot draconians (it will confuse you too, so wear an amulet of clarity, or use it in emergencies, quaffing a potion of healing afterwards)
</li><li><a href="/Mass_Confusion" title="Mass Confusion">Mass Confusion</a> if you lack <a href="/Alistair%27s_Intoxication" title="Alistair's Intoxication">Alistair's Intoxication</a>, for the same purpose but with a chance to fail (but it also works on non-humanoids!)
</li><li><a href="/Tukima%27s_Dance" title="Tukima's Dance">Tukima's Dance</a> to get rid of cursed weapons (or if you are desperate, to raise an army that will kill something hard for you)
</li><li><a href="/Delayed_Fireball" title="Delayed Fireball">Delayed Fireball</a> if you know <a href="/Fireball" title="Fireball">Fireball</a> and have nothing better to spend one slot on
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Buff_spells">Buff spells</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> to get in lich form, giving torment immunity, mutations immunity, rC+ rN+++ AC+7, necromancy enhancement and no food clock (<b>warning:</b> you will be vulnerable to Dispel Undead, so use Controlled Blink near necromancer ghosts, Shadow Fiends, Gloorx Vloq and random Pan lords to get out of its range)
</li><li><a href="/Regeneration" title="Regeneration">Regeneration</a> if you are not in lich form
</li><li><a href="/Condensation_Shield" title="Condensation Shield">Condensation Shield</a> for a magical shield
</li><li><a href="/Repel_Missiles" title="Repel Missiles">Repel Missiles</a>/<a href="/Deflect_Missiles" title="Deflect Missiles">Deflect Missiles</a> to reduce ranged attack hit rate
</li><li><a href="/Swiftness" title="Swiftness">Swiftness</a>/<a href="/Flight" title="Flight">Flight</a> to make you move faster, and let you cross water and lava
</li><li><a href="/Insulation" title="Insulation">Insulation</a> if you lack rElec otherwise
</li><li><a href="/Control_Teleport" title="Control Teleport">Control Teleport</a> if you don't have or want to wear a ring of teleport control (and lack the mutation)
</li><li><a href="/index.php?title=Ozocubu%27s_Armor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ozocubu's Armor (page does not exist)">Ozocubu's Armor</a> for the AC bonus, or <a href="/Stoneskin" title="Stoneskin">Stoneskin</a> if you trained Earth Magic but not Ice Magic
</li><li><a href="/Phase_Shift" title="Phase Shift">Phase Shift</a> for the EV bonus: it is rare, but if you have it, use it!
</li><li><a href="/Ring_of_Flames" title="Ring of Flames">Ring of Flames</a> to get a fire enhancement level without an item and walk in <a href="/Fire_Storm" title="Fire Storm">Fire Storm</a> clouds, at the cost of rC-- (compensate with randarts, and don't use this if you would go to less than rC+)
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Life-or-death_emergency_spells">Life-or-death emergency spells</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="/Borgnjor%27s_Revivification" title="Borgnjor's Revivification">Borgnjor's Revivification</a> restores you to full HP instantly, but permanently reduces your full HP: you can't cast this in lich form
</li><li><a href="/Death%27s_Door" title="Death's Door">Death's Door</a> makes you invulnerable for a few turns, but leaves you at 13-26 HP: this is of dubious value due to the risk, and especially since you can't cast it in lich form (probably use Borgnjor's instead)
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stat_Strategy">Stat Strategy</span></h2>
<p>Always increase Intelligence, unless you have skills below 8 and are not in the early game.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Game_Plan">Game Plan</span></h2>
<p>Start by using your low level spells, and make sure to memorize spells immediately after you gain a level. When you find the Temple, worship your god of choice: either <a href="/Sif_Muna" title="Sif Muna">Sif Muna</a> for a smooth game with much less risk and variance, <a href="/Vehumet" title="Vehumet">Vehumet</a> for a low-management but slightly riskier early game, or <a href="/Kikubaaqudgha" title="Kikubaaqudgha">Kikubaaqudgha</a> if you plan to rely on <a href="/Sublimation_of_Blood" title="Sublimation of Blood">Sublimation of Blood</a>. Establish a stash in the <a href="/Temple" title="Temple" class="mw-redirect">Temple</a> if you need to, otherwise, do so in the <a href="/Lair" title="Lair" class="mw-redirect">Lair</a> when you find it. Early branches are dangerous for spellcasters: abuse <a href="/Mephitic_Cloud" title="Mephitic Cloud">Mephitic Cloud</a> and don't be afraid to retreat to regen MP by resting.
</p><p>The midgame is where things begin to gel. Once you learn level 6 bolt/cloud spells (Bolt of Fire/Cold, Freezing/Poisonous Cloud, etc...) very few monsters can stand up to them, assuming you don't get caught with no MP. Take things slowy and keep on the lookout for book shops. Try to have semicontrolled Blink before doing any branch end. Once you do, along with <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> and ideally <a href="/Deflect_Missiles" title="Deflect Missiles">Deflect Missiles</a>, take over the <a href="/Vestibule_of_Hell" title="Vestibule of Hell" class="mw-redirect">Vestibule of Hell</a> and establish a stash there.
</p><p>Once you can learn Fire Storm/Ice Storm and cast it with a decent success rate, do so, and familiarize yourself with their range, power, and coverage. At this point work on getting a full set of artefact gear with as many resistances as possible, while completing your spell repertoire -- easy if you worship Sif Muna, slightly more difficult if you follow Vehumet or Kiku. When you do, you can assault pretty much any level in the game. Congratulations!

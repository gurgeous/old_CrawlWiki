<ol><li>The first objective is to go through the changelog below and incorporate all the changes into appropriate wiki articles. <s>Cross out</s> the lines in the changelog once the updates have been done, or if they don't require any changes. If you think a page is up to date, make sure to add <a href="/Template:Version014" title="Template:Version014">Template:version014</a> (i.e.  {{version014}}) to the page. </li>
<li>The second objective is to go through <a href="/Category:Crystal_Ball_Articles" title="Category:Crystal Ball Articles">Category:Crystal Ball Articles</a>, update the history section of the pages in there, and remove the crystal ball category (unless they refer to 0.15 or trunk material). There may be some sentences that need to be changed from future to past tense. </li></ol>

<li> Greatly revised summoning spell sets.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Branches.2C_environment">Branches, environment</span></h3>
<hr />
<ul><li> <s>The main Dungeon is now fifteen levels.</li>
<li> A new branch: the Depths; entered from the end of Dungeon, it is five levels long and contains the entrance to the Realm of Zot.</s></li>
<li> <s>The Vaults are now entered from D:13-14 and need a rune to enter.</s></li>
<li> Abyssal stairs appear more frequently, and are fixed with depth.</li>
<li> <s>Ziggurats require only three runes to enter; an entrance is guaranteed in Depths, but still spawn as normal in Pan.</s></li>
<li> <s>Portals are no longer closed when carrying the Orb of Zot.</li>
<li> The Horn of Geryon is no longer necessary for entering Hell branches.</s></li>

<li> More Ziggurat enemy sets.</li>
<li> <s>Crypt endings now contain some pieces of thematic loot: draining and/or pain and/or vampiric weapons, rings of positive energy and amulets of warding, one of several unrands, the Necronomicon, or evokers/staves.</s></li>
<li> <s>Easy ice cave portals now appear only in D, Lair, and Orc; hard ice cave portals appear in Elf and rotating Lair branches.</s></li>
<li> <s>Portal timers have been generally shortened and made more consistent with each other; additionally, the shorter timer started upon first seeing them has been removed.</s></li>
<li> <s>The layout of the last level of the Vaults has been changed, with all four subsections being open at each corner.</s></li>
<li> <s>Gadget shops and wand shops have been merged; the resulting gadget shops now also sell rods.</s></li>
<li> The price of items in shops has been recalibrated.</li>
<li> <s>Pandemonium exits occur more frequently as the player obtains runes from Pandemonium.</s></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Character">Character</span></h3>
<hr />
<ul><li> <s>New species:</s>
<ul><li> <s>Formicids possess four strong arms to use large weapons together with shields, in addition to strong natural digging abilities and a permanent stasis effect.</s></li>
<li> <s>Vine stalkers regenerate quickly, but cannot heal with wands or potions; they possess innate spirit shield and an anti-magic bite.</s></li></ul></li>
<li> <s>Felids have an innate jump attack ability, allowing them to jump over other monsters and attack their target in a single turn.</s></li>
<li> <s>Felids can use wands.</s></li>
<li> <s>Demonspawns' negative energy facet has the second level of rN replaced by "black mark," which gives melee attacks a chance to heal the player and apply a bad status to the victim.</s></li>
<li> <s>The first two levels of the slow healing mutation only affect rates of healing when enemies are in sight (half and no healing for those levels respectively). Stat regeneration and the third level of the mutation are unchanged.</s></li>
<li> <s>Fast/slow movement mutations no longer occur randomly.</s></li>
<li> Recommended backgrounds and species have been adjusted; in particular, backgrounds can recommend species that don't necessarily recommend that background and vice versa (e.g. CK -&gt; Tr may be recommended whereas Tr -&gt; CK is not).</li>
<li> <s>Poison damage is now deterministic.</s></li>

<li> <s>The plain "dragon" is now known as "fire dragon".</s></li>
<li> <s>Dragons, drakes, crabs, and acid blobs no longer flee at low health.</s></li>
<li> <s>Jellies once again split.</s></li>
<li> <s>Monsters are subject to summon caps.</s></li>

<li> <s>Abominations don't heal naturally; those created from spells can heal by melding further with crawling corpses and macabre masses.</s></li>
<li> <s>New enemies:</s>
<ul><li> <s>Fauns, who hex the player before attacking from afar, and their larger brethren satyrs, who can empower their nearby allies.</li>
<li> Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike the player.</li>
<li> Thorn lotuses, plants adrift on the water that pepper the player with thorns fired from afar.</li>
<li> Thorn hunters, who fire volleys of thorns and create briar patches to impede their foes' movements.</li>
<li> Dryads, who turn the forest against you by casting Awaken Forest like spriggan druids and summoning snaplasher vines that pull their enemies around.</li>
<li> Water nymphs, who passively form a pool of water around themselves and strike down the player with said water.</li>
<li> Shambling mangroves, slow-moving, tough plants home to a nest of ravens or wasps.</li>
<li> Raiju, which can attack by transforming themselves into a bolt of lightning.</li>
<li> Worldbinders, abyssal enemies which summon low tier enemies from other branches.</li>
<li> Shock serpents, who build up electrical energy for a static discharge;</li>
<li> Mana vipers, snakes with an antimagic bite;</li>
<li> Naga sharpshooters, who snipe at the player with Portal Projectile;</li>
<li> Naga ritualists, who can amplify poison in enemies and also cast Olgreb's Toxic Radiance;</li>
<li> Salamander mystics, with Bolt of Magma, Haste Other, a single-target version of Ignite Poison, and Iskenderun's Mystic Blast;</li>
<li> Salamander firebrands, whose attacks cause a ring of flames to appear around the target.</li>
<li> Octopode crushers, who can throw both the victims they constrict as well as icicles.</s></li></ul></li>
<li> <s>A new set of enemies based on demonspawn, appearing in Pan.
<ul><li> Base types:</li>
<li> monstrous (auxiliary attacks and more HP);</li>
<li> gelid (rC++ and icemail - bonus AC which dissipates on fire damage);</li>
<li> infernal (rF++ and fire attacks);</li>
<li> putrid (rPois, gains HP on nearby kills);</li>
<li> torturous (augmentation, powered by pain, and spines).</li>
<li> Classes:</li>
<li> blood saint (Legendary Destruction, which casts random powerful conjurations, and Ephemeral Infusion, which temporarily heals nearby allies);</li>
<li> chaos champions (Chaotic Reflection, which inflicts a random hex-like effect on itself and the target, and Random Bolt as per the rod of destruction);</li>
<li> warmongers (Grand Avatar, essentially a hybrid battlesphere and spectral weapon which triggers on sufficiently damaging attacks of nearby allies, and Sap Magic, a hex which hinders spellcasting success progressively as spells are cast);</li>
<li> corrupters (Plane Rend, which summons high tier enemies from other branches, and Corrupt Body, which inflicts a small set of temporary mutations);</li>
<li> black suns (Black Mark, which empowers nearby allies with various draining attacks that heal on hit, and previously existing spells Bolt of Draining, Malign Offering, and Dispel Undead).</s></li></ul></li>
<li> Adjustments to lair branch enemies:
<ul><li> <s>Spriggan druids' Druid's Call now calls 2-3 creatures out of LOS nearby and does not invisibly might creatures; instead, nearby creatures are healed and frenzied on their death. Stone Arrow also replaces Sunray in their spell set.</s></li>
<li> <s>Siren songs' pulling effects are now irresistible if the player is already mesmerised.</s></li>
<li> <s>Siren songs call drowned souls, weak temporary enemies with a drowning attack.</s></li>
<li> Manticores' spines now embed themselves in targets, causing damage while moving until a few turns is spent doing nothing to remove them.</li>
<li> <s>Harpies no longer steal food or eat food off of the ground.</s></li>
<li> <s>Plain salamanders have been weakened, and all salamanders can slither around on land.</s></li></ul></li>
<li> Adjustments to other enemies:
<ul><li> <s>Quokkas are speed 12 (making them effectively identical to grey rats).</s></li>
<li> <s>Boggarts are more durable.</s></li>
<li> <s>Rakshasas gain a monster spell "Phantom Mirror", which summons a clone of a nearby allied monster with half the hit points, with a 50% chance of swapping the clone for the original; this replaces their previous self-cloning abilities.  They can now also cast Iskenderun's Mystic Blast and will summon two clones of themselves at 50% HP as a one-time effect.</s></li>
<li> <s>Giant orange brains get Mass Confusion instead of Confusion.</s></li>
<li> Spriggans in general now merely have fast movement speed instead of fast speed in general, more damage and less EV.</li>
<li> <s>Spriggan air mages have Haste (replacing Shock).</li>
<li> Deep elf demonologists summon more greater demons instead of minor demons.</li>
<li> Draconian knights have fewer but distinct spell sets focusing on ice and necromancy.</li>
<li> Gargoyles and molten gargoyles now have Stone Arrow and Bolt of Magma respectively, and generate with mace-type weapons.</li>
<li> Metal gargoyles are now war gargoyles - fast and with the ability to fire metal fragments at targets.</li>
<li> Crystal golems are now crystal guardians - less health, but with the ability to fire crystal bolts that bounce off of all walls and deal either fire or cold damage on a per-bolt basis.</li>
<li> Ravens and eldritch tentacles no longer eat corpses.</s></li></ul></li>
<li> <s>New uniques:</s>
<ul><li> <s>Asterion, a minotaur of Makhleb who flings Major Destruction and can employ Spectral Weapon with his demon weapon;</s></li>
<li> <s>Natasha, a felid ex-familiar with minor spellcasting abilities;</s></li>
<li> <s>Vashnia, leader of a squad of naga sharpshooters with translocational ability to match.</s></li></ul></li>
<li> <s>Moths of suppression, rock worms, lava fish, lemures, jellyfish, grey rats, spiny worms, giant amoebae, deep dwarf berserkers, agate snails, giant centipedes, rotting devils, clay golems, and stone golems are no more.</s></li>
<li> <s>Ball lightnings are no longer permanently confused, instead seeking out targets like giant spores.</s></li>
<li> <s>Killer Klowns have a different set of possible damage brands: strong poison, pain, drain speed, fire, cold, electric, and anti-magic.</s></li>
<li> <s>Flying enemies are no longer immune to throwing nets.</li>
<li> Geryon can fly once again.</li>
<li> Antaeus gains Flash Freeze, an ice conjuration which impedes the target's movement for three turns.</li>
<li> Player ghosts can retain and cast dazzling spray, which has a chance to cause a confusion effect against the player.</s></li>
<li> <s>All pandemonium lords now see invisible</s>.</li>
<li> <s>The Enchantress now appears as a normal unique in the Depths.</s></li>
<li> <s>Josephine has a new spell set - Ghostly Fireball, Dispel Undead, Vampiric Draining, and Animate Dead - and rN+++.</li>
<li> Lamia has been de-throned.</s></li></ul>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="So.2C_what_do_centaurs_have_to_offer.3F">So, what do centaurs have to offer?</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Species_Mutations">Species Mutations</span></h3>
<p>The inherent handicaps centaurs have to deal with can be a little intimidating when you first look at them. They come with the <a href="/Deformed" title="Deformed" class="mw-redirect">Deformed</a> <a href="/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a>, reducing the <a href="/AC" title="AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> value of any body armour they wear by half its base AC, and the combination of <a href="/Herbivorous" title="Herbivorous" class="mw-redirect">Herbivorous</a> and <a href="/Fast_Metabolism" title="Fast Metabolism" class="mw-redirect">Fast Metabolism</a> makes the hunger game a little more stressful than normal. These make it difficult to play a centaur as a melee brute, as they can't rely so much on armour to keep them intact, and there's a high hunger cost each time you sit around healing.
</p><p>Fortunately, their positive traits greatly outweigh these costs. <a href="/Tough_Skin" title="Tough Skin" class="mw-redirect">Tough Skin</a> gives them a free +3 to AC, compensating for the Deformed penalty for most light and medium armours, and gives them a little more survivability than the average <a href="/Robe" title="Robe">robe</a>-wearer in the early game. <a href="/Hooves" title="Hooves" class="mw-redirect">Hooves</a> makes them significantly more capable in melee combat, and also replaces their access to <a href="/Boots" title="Boots">boots</a> (base AC 2, max enchantment +2) with access to <a href="/Centaur_barding" title="Centaur barding">centaur barding</a> (base AC 4, max enchantment +4). Those two mutations combined overcome the Deformed penalty once you manage to pick up some decent equipment, and when mixed with their natural +10% HP, they can be played as serious bruisers in the late game.
</p><p>Of course, the most important feature of centaurs is their excellent <a href="/Movement" title="Movement">movement</a> speed, which is enough to render defensive stats much less important (at least in the early- and mid-game). A centaur moves 30% faster than average, and as long as they have access to a ranged weapon and a safe pillar to prance around, they can <a href="/Kite" title="Kite" class="mw-redirect">kite</a> any melee threat without fear. Get into the habit of tactical cowardice if you want to survive.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Skill_Aptitudes">Skill Aptitudes</span></h3>
<p>Although better off than <a href="/Troll" title="Troll">trolls</a>, centaurs have a fairly lousy set of <a href="/Skill" title="Skill">skill</a> <a href="/Aptitude" title="Aptitude">aptitudes</a>. Except for <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a> and <a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a> (which get zeroes), all their melee skills are slightly below average (-1). Magical options are significantly worse, with -1s across the board except for <a href="/Poison_Magic" title="Poison Magic">Poison Magic</a> (-2) and <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> (a brutal -3). Defensive skills are the worst of all, with -3 in <a href="/Armour_(skill)" title="Armour (skill)">Armour</a>, <a href="/Shields_(skill)" title="Shields (skill)">Shields</a>, <i>and</i> <a href="/Dodging" title="Dodging">Dodging</a> (which is further penalized by their large <a href="/Size" title="Size">size</a>). Even their utility skill aptitudes suck; <a href="/Traps" title="Traps">Traps</a> gets a -2 (it's hard to spot hidden triggers from so high up), and the combination of Hooves, large size, and a -3 <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a> aptitude makes sneaky centaurs almost unheard of.
</p><p>The only things centaurs really excel at are <a href="/Invocations" title="Invocations">Invocations</a> (+1) and ranged combat. With +1s in <a href="/Slings" title="Slings">Slings</a> and <a href="/Crossbows" title="Crossbows">Crossbows</a> and +3s in <a href="/Throwing" title="Throwing">Throwing</a> and <a href="/Bows" title="Bows">Bows</a>, many centaur players seek out solid ranged weapons as soon as they can. Skilled centaur archers can slaughter melee opponents without taking a hit, and most dangerous <a href="/Unique" title="Unique" class="mw-redirect">unique</a> casters can't hit you with anything if you just keep them at the edge of your <a href="/Line_of_sight" title="Line of sight">line of sight</a>.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Centaur_Archer_Build">The Centaur Archer Build</span></h2>
<p>By far the most popular option for playing a centaur is to get a <a href="/Bow" title="Bow">bow</a> as early as possible, at which point you can start dealing damage to enemies anywhere in your <a href="/Line_of_sight" title="Line of sight">line of sight</a>. Mixed with your speed, you can kite most melee threats with ease; suddenly, early <a href="/Hill_giant" title="Hill giant">hill giants</a> and <a href="/Troll" title="Troll">trolls</a> are something to look forward to. Just make sure to watch your ammo...
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stat_Points">Stat Points</span></h3>
<p>Above all else, you need high <a href="/Dexterity" title="Dexterity">dexterity</a>, which is something centaurs don't begin with much of. Ignore strength and <a href="/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a>; you'll have decent strength to begin with and will naturally gain more as you level up, and intelligence is useless since you are in no way a spellcaster. Once your intelligence is safely at 8 or higher, dump every spare stat point you get into dexterity.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Equipment">Equipment</span></h3>
<p>Obviously, you're going to want a bow. You can start off with one by playing a <a href="/Hunter" title="Hunter">Hunter</a> or <a href="/Arcane_Marksman" title="Arcane Marksman">Arcane Marksman</a>, but any background can find one early on, either as randomly generated equipment or, less painlessly, in the possession of an enemy <a href="/Centaur_(monster)" title="Centaur (monster)">centaur</a>. Make sure to grab all the <a href="/Arrow" title="Arrow">arrows</a> you can find; early on, running out of ammunition is a serious threat.
</p><p>Although you can fire arrows in melee without penalty, you'll want a melee weapon in order to conserve your ammo, and since you're using a bow, <a href="/Shields" title="Shields">shields</a> won't really be an option. Therefore, you'll eventually want a solid two-handed weapon to maximize damage when you actually go into melee with opponents, but early on the skill requirements for those will be much too high. Try to find a nice <a href="/Electrocution" title="Electrocution">electrocution</a> or <a href="/Draining" title="Draining">draining</a> branded light weapon early on, and eventually upgrade to heavier and heavier options as you improve your weapon skill.
</p><p><a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a> is also an option, and one that trains slightly faster than weapons, but you miss out on the opportunity for branded or artifact weapons. The choice is yours.
</p><p>You may eventually want to cast a few spells, but for most of the game you'll be functioning as a purely physical character. Since spell failure doesn't matter and your <a href="/EV" title="EV" class="mw-redirect">EV</a> is already penalized by your size, you'll want the biggest, heaviest armour you can wear (unless you're fighting with Unarmed Combat, in which case anything heavier than <a href="/Scale_mail" title="Scale mail">scale mail</a> will seriously reduce your attack speed). Slap on a barding as soon as you find one, and put on some <a href="/Plate_armour" title="Plate armour">plate armour</a> once you have 18 <a href="/Strength" title="Strength">strength</a>. It may reduce your accuracy a little, but it's worth it for the added survivability. If you find a nicely enchanted lighter armour, or one that grants <a href="/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>, <a href="/Cold" title="Cold">cold</a>, or <a href="/Poison" title="Poison">poison</a> resistance, definitely wear that instead for the early game. Your end goal should probably be a fully enchanted <a href="/Fire_dragon_armour" title="Fire dragon armour">fire dragon armour</a>, <a href="/Ice_dragon_armour" title="Ice dragon armour">ice dragon armour</a>, or (if you have your resistances covered elsewhere) <a href="/Pearl_dragon_armour" title="Pearl dragon armour">pearl dragon armour</a>. Save your <a href="/Scrolls_of_enchant_armour" title="Scrolls of enchant armour" class="mw-redirect">scrolls of enchant armour</a> for those.
</p><p>While bows are weak and benefit highly from damage enchantments, try to conserve your <a href="/Scrolls_of_enchant_weapon" title="Scrolls of enchant weapon">scrolls of enchant weapon</a> for the longbow you'll eventually be using. Preferably, that'll be a <a href="/Vorpal" title="Vorpal">vorpal</a> or <a href="/Venom" title="Venom">venom</a> longbow for maximum damage out of your normal arrows; while <a href="/Flaming" title="Flaming">flaming</a> and <a href="/Frost" title="Frost" class="mw-redirect">frost</a> bows are also useful in the early game, you eventually get access to enough elemental ammo that they aren't necessary. Keep a stack of 100 regular arrows and 30 of each kind of specialty arrow and you'll be able to deal with any sort of resistance or vulnerability you come across without weighing yourself down too much. <a href="/Dispersal_(brand)" title="Dispersal (brand)">Dispersal</a> branded arrows aren't quite so crucial; although you'll want to keep maybe 5 around in case of emergencies, you rarely need more than one to escape a particular crisis.
</p><p>Although jewelry shows up too randomly for much definite advice, try to use those slots to plug any holes in your resistances. This should include <a href="/Magic_resistance" title="Magic resistance">magic resistance</a>; centaurs have little natural magic resistance, so bringing a <a href="/Ring_of_protection_from_magic" title="Ring of protection from magic">ring of protection from magic</a> or two with you can help save you from an untimely <a href="/Paralysis" title="Paralysis">paralysis</a> or trip to <a href="/The_Abyss" title="The Abyss">the Abyss</a>. That being said, since you'll spend most of the game kiting enemies from beyond their range of attack, you can focus on offense a little more safely; wearing a <a href="/Ring_of_slaying" title="Ring of slaying">ring of slaying</a> is rarely a bad idea.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gods">Gods</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Okawaru" title="Okawaru">Okawaru</a> or <a href="/Trog" title="Trog">Trog</a> are the safest bets here by far. Both provide access to near-infinite ammo once you get their <a href="/Piety" title="Piety">piety</a> flowing, and both give you new weapons, hopefully granting you a beefy <a href="/Longbow" title="Longbow">longbow</a> early on. The main difference lies in the fact that Okawaru offers you useful armour gifts as well, while Trog has the better panic buttons.
</p><p>You can easily get a 3-<a href="/Rune" title="Rune" class="mw-redirect">rune</a> win with either of these choices, but you'll absolutely want to switch to <a href="/The_Shining_One" title="The Shining One">the Shining One</a> once you reach the extended game. A <a href="/Holy_wrath" title="Holy wrath">holy wrath</a> longbow or two-handed weapon can wreak havoc against anything you'll find in the <a href="/Hell" title="Hell">Hells</a>, <a href="/The_Tomb" title="The Tomb">the Tomb</a>, and <a href="/Pandemonium" title="Pandemonium">Pandemonium</a>, and it's very hard to beat the rN+++, healing on kills, angelic support, and area-of-effect burst attack TSO offers. On top of that, the ability to quickly switch to <a href="/Zin" title="Zin">Zin</a> for the <a href="/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a> resistance and/or curing is always nice. Just make sure to learn <a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a> and get it online fast after leaving Trog or Okawaru to better deal with the penance.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Skills">Skills</span></h3>
<p>Once you have a bow, focus Bows until it hits 20. If this is on turn 1, feel free to turn everything else off; you can survive <a href="/Dungeon" title="Dungeon" class="mw-redirect">Dungeon</a>:1-2 safely stabbing weaker opponents with whatever melee weapons you find lying around and shooting the <a href="/Gnoll" title="Gnoll">gnolls</a>, <a href="/Adder" title="Adder">adders</a>, and humanoids wielding runed weapons to death from safety. Hopefully by then you've found a decent weapon of the type you'd like to use. <a href="/Long_blades" title="Long blades" class="mw-redirect">Long blades</a> and <a href="/Axes" title="Axes">axes</a> are recommended, though <a href="/Maces_%26_flails" title="Maces &amp; flails" class="mw-redirect">maces &amp; flails</a> works well too. The <a href="/Reaching" title="Reaching">reaching</a> advantage <a href="/Polearms" title="Polearms">polearms</a> offer is redundant when coupled with your bow, and their 2-handed weapons are inferior, so avoid those. <a href="/Staves" title="Staves">Staves</a> are also an option, but not a terribly competitive one. Once you have your chosen melee weapon, start training that as well.
</p><p>Once you've gotten your weapon speed to its minimum delay, switch to training <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a>; the added <a href="/HP" title="HP" class="mw-redirect">HP</a> is useful. Once you find a suit of armour heavier than <a href="/Ring_mail" title="Ring mail">ring mail</a>, turn on <a href="/Armour_(skill)" title="Armour (skill)">Armour</a> until it hits level 2, but don't sink too much <a href="/Experience" title="Experience">experience</a> into it while your combat skills need work. These skills will make up the majority of what you use throughout the game.
</p>
<ul><li>You'll eventually want your Bows skill to hit 27 for the added damage output you get. Try to hit 15-20 by the time you finish the <a href="/Orcish_Mines" title="Orcish Mines">Orcish Mines</a>.
</li><li>Fighting is another one worth maxing out, though this will take much longer than Bows; getting it to 10 by the time you hit <a href="/The_Lair" title="The Lair">the Lair</a> is a good idea.
</li><li>Your melee weapon skill should be leveled high enough to reach its minimum delay. This will take longer, but is worthwhile. Once you've mastered Bows and Fighting, feel free to raise it higher.
<ul><li>If using <a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a>, make this a much higher priority. While you shouldn't neglect Fighting, UC is the more important choice. Try to keep them at a 2:1 ratio.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Armour is a pain to train, but worth it when you're wearing heavy body armour. Getting it to 5 by the end of Lair, 10 by D:20, and 15 by the end of the game is reasonable (but more is always welcome).
</li><li><a href="/Dodge" title="Dodge" class="mw-redirect">Dodge</a> is another agonizing skill to train, but with your (eventually) impressive dexterity score, it pays off fairly quickly. By the time you find your dragon armour, you should be able to focus Dodge for a while in order to receive some very impressive evasion gains. Training it until your EV hits 20+ is a good idea, but don't bother with it until you've cleared Lair at the earliest.
</li><li>Neglecting <a href="/Traps" title="Traps">Traps</a> for too long is always painful. Once you hit Lair, turn it on until it hits at least 6. Getting it to 10-12 by the end game is strongly recommended.
</li><li><a href="/Invocations" title="Invocations">Invocations</a> will matter early on if you worship Okawaru; train it until Finesse has about a 10% failure rate. Once you switch to TSO, focus Invocations until it hits 27.
</li><li><a href="/Evocations" title="Evocations">Evocations</a> can be ignored; you don't need <a href="/Wand" title="Wand">wands</a> when you have hundreds of rounds of multielemental damage output. Consider it only if you find an amazing <a href="/Rod" title="Rod">rod</a> early on.
</li><li>Once you've got your dragon armour, you should consider learning some basic utility magic. Even with your low intelligence, there are a number of useful low level spells that can be acquired without too much trouble. <a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a>, <a href="/Apportation" title="Apportation">Apportation</a>, and <a href="/Shroud_of_Golubria" title="Shroud of Golubria">Shroud of Golubria</a> are all useful spells that you can master just by studying <a href="/Translocations" title="Translocations">Translocations</a>. Add in some skill in <a href="/Charms" title="Charms">Charms</a> and <a href="/Air_Magic" title="Air Magic">Air Magic</a> and you can unlock <a href="/Fly" title="Fly">Fly</a> and <a href="/Repel_Missiles" title="Repel Missiles">Repel Missiles</a>. <a href="/Portal_Projectile" title="Portal Projectile">Portal Projectile</a> will take a little longer to train, but the ability to make your longbow a <a href="/Smite" title="Smite" class="mw-redirect">smite</a>-targeted attack is tempting. If you're feeling <i>really</i> ambitious, you can hammer down on Charms until <a href="/Haste" title="Haste">Haste</a> becomes available, but it's better to duplicate the effect with a <a href="/Wand_of_hasting" title="Wand of hasting">wand of hasting</a>, especially since you won't be training Spellcasting very fast at all.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Centaur_Poker_Build">The Centaur Poker Build</span></h2>
<p>One issue I always had with centaur archers was the fact that, in the late game, I found it much safer to fight things in melee range than at a distance. Monsters with <a href="/Torment" title="Torment">torment</a> are much less likely to do so when they have the option of simply punching you for a little bit of damage, and the Shining One's Cleansing Flame ability is amazingly effective when you have 27 Invocations and a horde of demonic or undead opponents around you. Therefore, this build ignores all ranged weapons and avoids wasting experience on skills you eventually stop using. It requires a bit more care in play, but results in a much hardier late game character.
</p><p>Any background that provides you with a polearm could conceivably take this path. The reliance on the polearm's reaching brand diminishes as you develop a more experienced and heavily defended character, so other weapon choices or backgrounds are also valid, but surviving the early game with no ability to kite is a much less pleasant experience.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Melee_Kiting">Melee Kiting</span></h3>
<p>Although most pure melee fighters sacrifice the ability to kite enemies easily, as a centaur you are superhumanly fast. With a good polearm in hand, you can fight opponents who are safely out of reach almost as well as you could with a bow. Simply retreat from the enemy until you create an empty space, then use your <a href="/Reaching" title="Reaching">reaching</a> capacity to stab the guy (press '<b>v'</b> to evoke your weapon, or simply <a href="/Tab" title="Tab">Tab</a> if nothing else is around). It forces you to pay much more attention to your fights than if you simply used a bow, but since the best polearms are one-handed weapons (<a href="/Trident" title="Trident">tridents</a> and <a href="/Demon_trident" title="Demon trident">demon tridents</a>), you are able to also use a shield, greatly increasing your durability. Also, the lack of concern over ammo frees up your inventory and god choice significantly, and allows for a more varied gameplay style. Finally, any end-game quality melee weapon you wind up using will do more damage per hit than an arrow would, and that's before taking into account the power of your hooves.
</p><p>By far the biggest disadvantage of melee kiting is that you can no longer kite dangerous casters at the edge of your line of sight. When faced with these opponents, consider fleeing until you've got the right resistances or sheer damage output to take him out without too much risk.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stat_Points_2">Stat Points</span></h3>
<p>Just like before, dexterity is your best bet, even if strength may seem more important now. Even if you wind up wearing a <a href="/Large_shield" title="Large shield">large shield</a>, high EV is generally more useful than high <a href="/SH" title="SH" class="mw-redirect">SH</a>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Equipment_2">Equipment</span></h3>
<p>The most obvious difference here is that you'll want to find a polearm as quickly as possible instead of a bow. Spears are common, tridents somewhat less so (expect to find one in the hands of an <a href="/Orc" title="Orc">orc</a> not too far down). Gnolls may show up with <a href="/Halberd" title="Halberd">halberds</a> early on; while these do much more damage, they're inaccurate and very slow to attack with for low-level characters. Only use one if it's got a very nice brand or huge enchantment bonus.
</p><p>Also, keep an eye out for a <a href="/Blowgun" title="Blowgun">blowgun</a> and some <a href="/Poison" title="Poison">poison</a> and <a href="/Curare" title="Curare" class="mw-redirect">curare</a> <a href="/Needle" title="Needle">needles</a>. You don't need to have any training in <a href="/Throwing" title="Throwing">Throwing</a> to use those two needle types well, and curare is amazing for softening up those dangerous uniques you can no longer pepper with arrows in safety. <a href="/Wand" title="Wand">Wands</a> and especially <a href="/Rod" title="Rod">rods</a> are also worth paying a bit more attention to; there'll be far more use for them now.
</p><p>You'll want to start wearing a shield at some point, though it's less critical in the early game where most enemies only use melee. Try not to use a shield too far beyond your skill level; while centaurs are large and thus better able to use large shields, doing so at 0 Shields skill will hamper your attacks significantly.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gods_2">Gods</span></h3>
<p>Okawaru and Trog are still respectable, reliable choices, but you now have much less dependence on their ammo gifts. <a href="/Makhleb" title="Makhleb">Makhleb</a>'s healing on kills is extremely useful at any point in the game, and the abilities he offers give you some decent ranged attacks and summoning capacity. The Invocations skill necessary to use him well will come in handy when you switch to TSO, so that's not wasted either. <a href="/Yredelemnul" title="Yredelemnul">Yredelemnul</a> is also a decent choice; stabbing opponents from behind a wall of shambling corpses is a perfectly good way to avoid injury. <a href="/Zin" title="Zin">Zin</a>'s abilities are excellent for dealing with tough enemies and a centaur's hunger issues, mutation resistance is always welcome, and switching to TSO with near max piety speeds things up significantly. For something a little spicier, consider <a href="/Nemelex_Xobeh" title="Nemelex Xobeh">Nemelex Xobeh</a>. He'll cover your need for ranged attacks, summoning, and a whole lot more, though his penance is a bit nasty if you still choose to switch to TSO in the end.
</p><p><a href="/Cheibriados" title="Cheibriados">Cheibriados</a> would be almost impossible to use well, what with your fast movement speed, and <a href="/Fedhas_Madash" title="Fedhas Madash">Fedhas Madash</a>'s powers rely on the food source you get the most benefit from. As for the magic-related gods (<a href="/Sif_Muna" title="Sif Muna">Sif Muna</a>, <a href="/Vehumet" title="Vehumet">Vehumet</a>, and <a href="/Kikubaaqudgha" title="Kikubaaqudgha">Kikubaaqudgha</a>), you've got no use for most of the gifts they offer. And <a href="/Xom" title="Xom">Xom</a>... well, he's as much of an option as he ever is.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_2">Skills</span></h3>
<p>Same as before, except that there's no Bow training and you should focus your Polearms skill until you've gotten it to its minimum delay; this is very important if you want to be able to melee kite effectively. Keep training it at a normal pace for the rest of the game; you'll probably want to max it out eventually, but balance it with Fighting. The addition of the Shields skill is also a significant change. Because of its -3 aptitude, you probably won't want to level it up beyond what you need for the shield you are currently using (3 for <a href="/Buckler" title="Buckler">bucklers</a>, 9 for <a href="/Shield" title="Shield">shields</a>, 15 for <a href="/Large_shield" title="Large shield">large shields</a>). Leveling beyond that is experience that could be better spent on offensive skills or more Dodging.
</p><p>You may also want to put some training into the <a href="/Evocations" title="Evocations">Evocations</a> skill. Wands and rods are tremendously useful for giving you ranged attacks, and if you follow Nemelex you'll be training the skill anyway. The <a href="/Rod_of_Warding" title="Rod of Warding">rod of Warding</a>, <a href="/Rod_of_Destruction" title="Rod of Destruction" class="mw-redirect">rod of Destruction</a> (ice), <a href="/Rod_of_Venom" title="Rod of Venom">rod of Venom</a>, <a href="/Rod_of_Inaccuracy" title="Rod of Inaccuracy">rod of Inaccuracy</a>, and <a href="/Lightning_rod" title="Lightning rod">lightning rod</a> all provide you with useful spells.

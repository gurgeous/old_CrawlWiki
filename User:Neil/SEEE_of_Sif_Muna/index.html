<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Character_creation">Character creation</span></h2>
<p>Since <a href="/User:Neil/DDNE_of_Kikubaaqudgha" title="User:Neil/DDNE of Kikubaaqudgha">winning</a> with a <a href="/Deep_Dwarf" title="Deep Dwarf">Deep Dwarf</a> <a href="/Necromancer" title="Necromancer">Necromancer</a>, I wanted to try a different approach, one that does not rely on summons and undead.  I tried a <a href="/Mountain_Dwarf" title="Mountain Dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</a> <a href="/Hunter" title="Hunter">Hunter</a> of <a href="/Nemelex_Xobeh" title="Nemelex Xobeh">Nemelex Xobeh</a> ("Wilford Beardwagon"), which went reasonably well, but I wanted to get back to magic for a while.  After that I played a <a href="/Deep_Elf" title="Deep Elf">Deep Elf</a> <a href="/Conjurer" title="Conjurer">Conjurer</a> (fire+earth) ("Elrond Hubbar"), and found myself using <a href="/Stone_Arrow" title="Stone Arrow">Stone Arrow</a> quite a bit.  I thought I would try optimising for <a href="/Earth_Magic" title="Earth Magic">Earth Magic</a> rather than <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> and <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a>, so I went with a <a href="/Sludge_Elf" title="Sludge Elf">Sludge Elf</a> <a href="/Earth_Elementalist" title="Earth Elementalist">Earth Elementalist</a>.  While this character doesn't have the massive MP pool, or the <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> aptitude, that a <a href="/Deep_Elf" title="Deep Elf">Deep Elf</a> would, the extra HP are worth it.
</p><p>In defiance of societal standards of maturity and taste, I have named the character "Tari Blackstool".

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_game"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://s-z.org/neil/crawl/SEEE-Sif-XL13-2011-07-19.txt">Early game</a></span></h2>
<p>I got to XL 3 and learned Stone Arrow before leaving the first level of the dungeon.  Besides doing a nice chunk of damage, this is the only conjuration spell in the <a href="/Book_of_Geomancy" title="Book of Geomancy">Book of Geomancy</a>, and thus my ticket to learning even better magic for blowing things up.  I stayed empty-handed until I reached level 1 in <a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a>, and switched to <a href="/Short_Blades" title="Short Blades">Short Blades</a>.  Before I could even gain a rank, though, I found two ego <a href="/Quarterstaff" title="Quarterstaff">quarterstaves</a> on D:3: <a href="/Protection" title="Protection">protection</a> and <a href="/Speed" title="Speed">speed</a>.  I took this as a sign and switched.  Ijyb was also on D:3, but posed no problem and gave me XL 5.  The sewers ("water treatment center" variant) were on this level as well, and were also easy: for the most part I used <a href="/Sandblast" title="Sandblast">Sandblast</a> or the quarterstaff; besides the usual loot, there was a random <a href="/Book_of_Clouds" title="Book of Clouds">Book of Clouds</a> lying about.  As a parting gift, D:3 gave me a +6 <a href="/Ring_of_evasion" title="Ring of evasion">ring of evasion</a>.  I learned <a href="/Passwall" title="Passwall">Passwall</a> and <a href="/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction" title="Lee&#39;s Rapid Deconstruction">Lee's Rapid Deconstruction</a> while on D:3.
</p><p>On D:4 I killed Grinder easily, then found the staircase to the <a href="/Ecumenical_Temple" title="Ecumenical Temple">Ecumenical Temple</a>.  I converted to <a href="/Sif_Muna" title="Sif Muna">Sif Muna</a> and set up a temporary stash until I reach the Lair.  D:4 had a +4 <a href="/Ring_of_dexterity" title="Ring of dexterity">ring of dexterity</a> and a wand of cold, and D:5 the <a href="/List_of_unrands#.2B0_cloak_of_.22Starlight.22" title="List of unrands">cloak of Starlight</a>.  While I was hoping to be stealthy, I'll trade that for <a href="/Cold_resistance" class="mw-redirect" title="Cold resistance">rCold</a>, <a href="/Electricity_resistance" class="mw-redirect" title="Electricity resistance">rElec</a>, and +4 to <a href="/Evasion" title="Evasion">evasion</a>.  D:5 also had a <a href="/Book_of_Unlife" title="Book of Unlife">Book of Unlife</a>, though I'm not intending on having allies other than <a href="/Orb_of_Destruction" title="Orb of Destruction">Orb of Destruction</a> so it's mostly useless.
</p><p>D:6 had Pikel, who died to a few Stone Arrows; as well as a robe of magic resistance and an <a href="/Evocable_items#Efreet_flask" title="Evocable items">efreet flask</a>.  D:7 was full of uniques, as well as a ghost of a previous incarnation of this character.  There was <a href="/Crazy_Yiuf" title="Crazy Yiuf">Crazy Yiuf</a> (yet another quarterstaff), <a href="/Blork_the_orc" title="Blork the orc">Blork the orc</a>, <a href="/Menkaure" title="Menkaure">Menkaure</a>, and <a href="/Joseph" title="Joseph">Joseph</a>.  It also had a <a href="/Book_of_Fire" title="Book of Fire">Book of Fire</a>, <a href="/Book_of_Spatial_Translocations" title="Book of Spatial Translocations">Book of Spatial Translocations</a>, and a <a href="/Crossbow" class="mw-redirect" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a>.  I learned <a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a> and <a href="/Mephitic_Cloud" title="Mephitic Cloud">Mephitic Cloud</a>, stashed my spellbooks, and proceeded on.
</p><p>D:8 had an antique weapon shop, and D:9 the staircase to the <a href="/Orcish_Mines" title="Orcish Mines">Orcish Mines</a>, but the levels were otherwise unnotable.  On D:10 I fell through a shaft to D:11; a little while later, I met Gastronok.  His summons kept blocking line of effect, but eventually I managed to get next to him and alternate <a href="/Stone_Arrow" title="Stone Arrow">Stone Arrow</a> with whacks from the quarterstaff of speed.  He died quickly after that, giving me a <a href="/Wizard_hat" title="Wizard hat">wizard hat</a> of <a href="/Magic_resistance" class="mw-redirect" title="Magic resistance">magic resistance</a>.  Later on D:11 (after going back up and clearing D:10) I encountered a Psyche and Josephine tag team.  I led them to the doorway, with Josephine's zombies conveniently blocking line of effect for her <a href="/Wand_of_polymorph_other" title="Wand of polymorph other">wand of polymorph other</a>, and cast <a href="/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction" title="Lee&#39;s Rapid Deconstruction">LRD</a> repeatedly, killing them both fairly quickly.  I then found an awesome randart: the +0 leather armour "Jykh" {+Inv rF++ Dex+2}.  I switched from my robe of magic resistance, of course.  This means I now have rC+ rF++ rElec from armour alone.  The level also had a <a href="/Magical_staff" title="Magical staff">staff of air</a>, which was precisely the opposite of what I wanted.
</p><p>D:11 had the stairs to <a href="/The_Lair" title="The Lair">the Lair</a>, so I entered.  The first level yielded a <a href="/Book_of_Conjurations_(ice%2Bair)" title="Book of Conjurations (ice+air)">Book of Conjurations (ice+air)</a>, from which I memorized <a href="/Throw_Frost" title="Throw Frost">Throw Frost</a>.  After clearing the level, I memorized Bolt of Magma and decided to replace <a href="/Throw_Frost" title="Throw Frost">Throw Frost</a> with <a href="/Magic_Dart" title="Magic Dart">Magic Dart</a>, since at the moment I seem to have more options with Fire Magic.  I took a short break to move my stash from the Temple, then proceeded downward.  Lair:2 had a randart leather armour that was vastly inferior to my current one, and a crystal ball of some sort.  Lair:3 had a <a href="/Book_of_Zoology" class="mw-redirect" title="Book of Zoology">Book of Zoology</a> and a <a href="/Book_of_Minor_Magic" title="Book of Minor Magic">Book of Minor Magic</a>, from which I learned <a href="/Summon_Butterflies" title="Summon Butterflies">Summon Butterflies</a> and <a href="/Repel_Missiles" title="Repel Missiles">Repel Missiles</a>.
</p><p>On Lair:4 Sif Muna granted me a randart spellbook focused on earth magic.  Two of the spells (Stoneskin and LRD) were duplicates from Geomancy, but two were new: <a href="/Iron_Shot" title="Iron Shot">Iron Shot</a> and <a href="/Statue_Form" title="Statue Form">Statue Form</a>.  This level also had boots of running, which makes me quite happy.  Lair:5 had the <a href="/The_Shoals" title="The Shoals">Shoals</a> staircase and a <a href="/Scroll_of_acquirement" title="Scroll of acquirement">scroll of acquirement</a>.  Since spellbooks don't seem to be a problem for the moment, I selected "staff" and claimed my <a href="/Magical_staff" title="Magical staff">staff of earth</a>.
</p><p>The Lair has been easy so far because of my evasion of 30 and nice stack of hit points: I can melee yaks without much risk, though I keep my distance from anything with a poisonous bite.  My next spell will probably be <a href="/Iron_Shot" title="Iron Shot">Iron Shot</a>, for those situations where <a href="/Stone_Arrow" title="Stone Arrow">Stone Arrow</a> just doesn't do enough damage.  <a href="/Ice_Form" title="Ice Form">Ice Form</a> is also a possibility, since I haven't trained up <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a> too far yet (only with <a href="/Bolt_of_Magma" title="Bolt of Magma">Bolt of Magma</a>).  
</p><p>I haven't done the Shoals before, so I think I'll clear out all but the bottom level of the Lair (and probably the other branch, Swamp or Snake) first.  Onward. . .
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lair:5-7.2C_Orc"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://s-z.org/neil/crawl/SEEE-Sif-XL14-2011-07-20.txt">Lair:5-7, Orc</a></span></h2>
<p>Lair:6 had stairways to both the <a href="/Snake_Pit" title="Snake Pit">Snake Pit</a> and <a href="/The_Slime_Pits" title="The Slime Pits">the Slime Pits</a>, but I did not take either just yet.  It was also full of <a href="/Blink_frog" title="Blink frog">blink frogs</a> and <a href="/Spiny_frog" class="mw-redirect" title="Spiny frog">spiny frogs</a>, but neither posed a threat.  Lair:7 turned up a randart +2 cloak with <a href="/Electricity_resistance" class="mw-redirect" title="Electricity resistance">rElec</a> and <a href="/MR" class="mw-redirect" title="MR">MR</a>; I'm still wearing Starlight for now, but should I need more stealth and MR, I'll switch.  Additionally, Sif gifted me a level 3 randart spellbok:  <a href="/Poison_Weapon" title="Poison Weapon">Poison Weapon</a>, <a href="/Tukima%27s_Dance" title="Tukima&#39;s Dance">Tukima's Dance</a>, <a href="/Abjuration" title="Abjuration">Abjuration</a>, <a href="/Call_Canine_Familiar" title="Call Canine Familiar">Call Canine Familiar</a>, <a href="/Recall" title="Recall">Recall</a>, and <a href="/Spider_Form" title="Spider Form">Spider Form</a>.  I learned Abjuration, since the <a href="/Rod_of_Demonology" class="mw-redirect" title="Rod of Demonology">Rod of Demonology</a> was almost necessary last time.  I also found a <a href="/Book_of_Power" title="Book of Power">Book of Power</a> here, so I swapped out Stone Arrow for <a href="/Iskenderun%27s_Mystic_Blast" title="Iskenderun&#39;s Mystic Blast">Iskenderun's Mystic Blast</a>: almost twice as much damage, and much more accuracy, for only one more mana.  This means Spellcasting will need some more work, though, to eliminate hungering from my primary attack.
</p><p>After clearing the penultimate floor of the Lair, I re-checked the shops and found a single item with rPois—and it was a banded mail so useless to me.  Off to the <a href="/Orcish_Mines" title="Orcish Mines">Orcish Mines</a>, then, since I might do Swamp without rPois, but not Snake.
</p><p>I had to go down to Orc:3 before I found multiple staircases.  I spent most of my time stair-dancing, luring five to eight orcs at a time.  I meleed the regular orcs and blasted the warriors and priests, using <a href="/Bolt_of_Magma" title="Bolt of Magma">Bolt of Magma</a> when I could line one up with a few ordinary orcs, Mystic Blast otherwise.  The spell hunger from Mystic Blast was noticeable, though the orc corpses provided enough nutrition.
</p><p>Orc:2 had an <a href="/Ice_cave" title="Ice cave">ice cave</a> portal.  The simulacra were no problem at all, but the freezing wraiths were fairly tough, requiring enough Bolts of Magma that I had to channel after every other wraith.  There were no big demons, only some white imps whom I meleed.  I went through most of my carried food, since I was channeling frequently, and a lone <a href="/Necromancer_(monster)" title="Necromancer (monster)">necromancer</a> left the only corpse in the place.  I came out with a staff of cold, a cap of cold resistance, and a few spellbooks: two <a href="/Book_of_Frost" title="Book of Frost">Books of Frost</a>, a <a href="/Book_of_Ice" title="Book of Ice">Book of Ice</a>, and a second <a href="/Book_of_Conjurations_(ice%2Bair)" title="Book of Conjurations (ice+air)">Book of Conjurations (ice+air)</a>.  I left the Mines to drop off the loot at the stash, picked up some more food, and returned.  Orc:2 had a number of shops, but none that I needed.  A different section of the level had the <a href="/Bailey" title="Bailey">Bailey</a> portal, but that didn't yield much: only an elven short sword of speed, which replaced a dagger of venom as my primary butchering tool.
</p><p>In a disconnected section of Orc:1, I met and killed both <a href="/Erica" title="Erica">Erica</a> and <a href="/Sonja" title="Sonja">Sonja</a>, and received my third gift, a <a href="/Transmutations" title="Transmutations">Transmutations</a> randart book: <a href="/Sticks_to_Snakes" title="Sticks to Snakes">Sticks to Snakes</a>, <a href="/Ignite_Poison" title="Ignite Poison">Ignite Poison</a> (already in my <a href="/Book_of_Fire" title="Book of Fire">Book of Fire</a>), <a href="/Blade_Hands" title="Blade Hands">Blade Hands</a>, and <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a> (nice!).  Orc:4 had <a href="/Jozef" title="Jozef">Jozef</a> and <a href="/Donald" title="Donald">Donald</a>.  The former was easy, but Donald had a shield of reflection, meaning most of my shots were missing.  He was a little too strong to melee, so I was happy to have the boots of running to keep my distance.  After being chased across two floors, I finally managed to put together enough firepower to take him down, and claimed the shield for my stash (though I don't think I'll wear it).
</p><p>The rest of Orc:4 was full of ogres, two-headed ogres (six of them), ogre magi (just two), and trolls.  The toughest inhabitants, though, were two <a href="/Rock_troll" title="Rock troll">rock trolls</a>, who gave me a bit of a beating just to convince me that, no, I am not a melee character.  They took quite a number of blasts, but eventually fell.  With the level clear, I checked the four shops and, sure enough, one had a ring of poison resistance.  I also bought a bit of permafood and two scrolls of recharging, then headed back to the Lair.  There I learned Iron Shot to meet my future large-scale blasting needs.
</p><p>Now that I have a high-level conjuration, I arguably should go back from IMB to Stone Arrow as my staple attack, but I think I'll keep it as it is for now.  I haven't used Mephitic Cloud much: I tried it on Donald but he must have had poison resistance from his armour.  I can definitely see arguments for swapping that out for <a href="/Alistair%27s_Intoxication" title="Alistair&#39;s Intoxication">Alistair's Intoxication</a> (which I did last game, and never regretted); I'd have to buy the <a href="/Book_of_Party_Tricks" title="Book of Party Tricks">Book of Party Tricks</a>, but I can afford it.  Passwall hasn't been much use yet, but I'll hang onto it for now.  In the longer term, I'd like to branch out into <a href="/Transmutations" title="Transmutations">Transmutations</a>, with enough <a href="/Necromancy" title="Necromancy">Necromancy</a> to be able to cast <a href="/Necromutation" title="Necromutation">Necromutation</a>.  My lowest-level Necromancy spell, though, is <a href="/Animate_Dead" title="Animate Dead">Animate Dead</a>, so it may be a while before that happens.
</p><p>Next stop is the <a href="/Snake_Pit" title="Snake Pit">Snake Pit</a>, then either <a href="/The_Shoals" title="The Shoals">the Shoals</a> or the <a href="/Elven_Halls" title="Elven Halls">Elven Halls</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Death"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://s-z.org/neil/crawl/SEEE-Sif-DEAD-2011-07-20.txt">Death</a></span></h2>
<p>On Snake:1 I killed a few <a href="/Black_mamba" title="Black mamba">black mambas</a> before running into an <a href="/Anaconda" title="Anaconda">anaconda</a>.  Even with the boots of running, it was fast enough to keep up with me.  I managed to get it to "heavily wounded", but my Evasion was not enough to avoid its constriction attack.  I died as I was quaffing a <a href="/Potion_of_speed" class="mw-redirect" title="Potion of speed">potion of speed</a> in hopes of getting away.  In retrospect, I completely forgot I had <a href="/Blink" title="Blink">Blink</a>, which would have given me enough time to drink the potion and get away.  I also should have stuck with Mystic Blast, as Iron Shot never managed to hit its target.  Oh well.

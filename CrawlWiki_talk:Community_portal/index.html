<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Poll_on_scrolls_of_acquirement">Poll on scrolls of acquirement</span></h2>
<p>There's not much hilarious life and dialogue in this wiki I observed. And there are no such things like polls that might change that. So I make an attempt to introduce it. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 23:04, 21 March 2013 (CET)
</p><p>What do you do *usually* when you find an identified scroll of acquirement?
</p><p>a) Read it immediately because any increase in power or shelter is crucial to success?
</p><p>b) Put it in a stash because as an advanced character in the deeper regions you will get better stuff?
</p><p>c) Use it soon to cover the worst weaknesses of your avatar, e. g. choose armour in hope for resistances for your spriggan?
</p><p>d) Put it aside because you might need later sth special for a Ziggurat/treasure trove access?
</p><p>Room for answers and debate:
</p>
<dl><dd>I generally use them immediately. Treasure troves usually request other things, and there's nothing more frustrating than dying knowing you hadn't used some resource that might have saved you. As for WHAT I pick, it's almost always armour, if only because there's usually an armour slot that would benefit from a ludicrously good artifact, even if the RNG usually gives me a crappy +2 ring mail of uselessness. The only reason I might save it is if I haven't even found a mundane item for a particular armour slot yet, as that tends to make the acquirement give you a boring normal item. --<a href="/User:MoogleDan" title="User:MoogleDan">MoogleDan</a> 23:53, 21 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I tend to a) use them immediately. Also I think that <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/">the official forums</a> or  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes">r/rogulikes</a> would be a much better place to have polls like this. You'll get more responses too =) --<a href="/index.php?title=User:Flun&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Flun (page does not exist)">Flun</a> 15:39, 22 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I normally do not use SoA immediately because I found out that the result in low depths (even Lair:2) and/or low XL tend to be be "pretty" disappointing. And like Dan it's mostly armour I acquire. - The proposals above are not meant as one and the other 3 not! I think that Dan's answer reflects that fine.</dd>
<dd>As for Flun's ideas I don't consent. Surely the wiki will never be a competion to those forums. On the other hand I don't intend to spread my activities to a lot of places like that. Just sometimes when I'm here editing some stuff I miss a little non too serious talk. - Beyond that I have a research interest in my topic that is genuinely attached to increasing knowledge (wiki's core mission). My questions investigate aspects of this scroll that are not in the code-database but in the gameplay itself. So it depends on completely individual traits of behaviour. Hope I made myself understood. (I don't have to explain such difficult connections frequently, it's not my native language.) -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 18:22, 22 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I always use them immediately. Weapons and wands are my usual choices. --<a href="/User:CommanderC" title="User:CommanderC">CommanderC</a> 19:36, 22 March 2013 (CET)
<dl><dd> Re Bwijn: You have a good point. Anyways, will you be joining us in our tournament team? --<a href="/index.php?title=User:Flun&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Flun (page does not exist)">Flun</a> 20:01, 22 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> I usually use them right off. As for what I request, it varies depending on the situation: I often ask for armor, but sometimes I'll ask for a weapon if I think I need a better one. If I'm running an Earth Elementalist and haven't found a staff of earth yet, I'll usually ask for that. <a href="/User:Spudwalt" title="User:Spudwalt">--spudwalt</a> 00:55, 23 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I generally use them immediately as well.  I've never noticed that huge a difference in acquirements between shallow and deep levels - it's not directly affected by depth anyway, it's just less likely to give you stuff you've already seen, so having seen a whole lot of items makes it less likely to give you some of the more common ones.  But that might be because I almost always acquire armour, or occasionally jewellery - in both cases, the "common" items are usually more useful than, for example, with spellbooks.  And you have the not-small chance of getting a randart.</dd>
<dd> The only case where I will "save" scrolls of acquirement, so to speak, is if they're in a shop.  In that case, I will usually wait until I have explored all of the shop-bearing branches, so I don't end up lacking the gold to buy something really awesome that I come across. -<a href="/User:Ion_frigate" title="User:Ion frigate">Ion frigate</a> 03:14, 23 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Will_you_get_warned.2C_if_new_trunk-versions_don.27t_.22stack.22.3F">Will you get warned, if new trunk-versions don't "stack"?</span></h2>
<p>As online games are much too frequently disconnected I've downloaded my own trunk version to play at home. I'm not sure if any new "builds" can be installed over the previous? I saw once while online gaming that a new build "stacked" without problems. Will there be warnings if not? Only in the bug section? -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 19:20, 27 July 2013 (CEST)
</p>
<dl><dd>Not sure, but a simple solution is to just make a backup copy of Crawl before you try it.  Just copy the whole directory/folder somewhere safe.  If it works, delete the backup if you don't want to feel like you're savescumming. -<a href="/User:Ion_frigate" title="User:Ion frigate">Ion frigate</a> 02:36, 28 July 2013 (CEST)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Backgrounds">Backgrounds</span></h2>
<p>Just curious why the <a href="/Background" title="Background">background</a> article is separate from the <a href="/List_of_backgrounds" class="mw-redirect" title="List of backgrounds">list of backgrounds</a>. There is probably a good reason for this I'm just foolishly not seeing it. If not, any thoughts about merging the two? One article to reference both doesn't look overly large. <a href="/User:Buddy23Lee" title="User:Buddy23Lee">Buddy23Lee</a> 01:27, 3 August 2013 (CEST)
</p>
<dl><dd>No reason at all! At least no substantial one. A lot of the original site framework has just stuck around due to being grandfathered in, and if it looks unreasonable, there is a good (but not 100%) chance that it's just been overlooked by others all this time. I think merging those two tiny pages makes sense, with <a href="/List_of_backgrounds" class="mw-redirect" title="List of backgrounds">List of backgrounds</a> being turned into a redirect to <a href="/Backgrounds#List_of_Backgrounds" class="mw-redirect" title="Backgrounds">Backgrounds#List of Backgrounds</a>.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks MoogleDan. I just wanted to make sure those types of merges aren't too controversial. I'm still trying to figure out if this wiki is better off with fewer, more centralized articles, or a larger number of smaller, more specific articles. Maybe I'm just overthinking things? <a href="/User:Buddy23Lee" title="User:Buddy23Lee">Buddy23Lee</a> 02:18, 3 August 2013 (CEST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

We all know that this wiki nowadays has a very discontinuous group of users who contribute. Thus a warning: do not trust too much in such template scripts, they aren't very reliable in the end. A fixed box of parameters as we had before was much more solid, even if it needed to updated manually. (Well, if there is somebody who could repair the concerning template that would be welcome. I'm not a programmer beyond basic knowledge and do not know where to search for it.) - And be aware that the developers have abandoned the wiki team while providing uncomplete documentations, example given: the new 0.18 <a href="/Book_of_Misfortune" title="Book of Misfortune">Book of Misfortune</a> that did not appear in the update listings. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Bwijn" title="User talk:Bwijn">talk</a>) 19:29, 18 August 2016 (CEST)

<dl><dd>I thoroughly disagree with not relying on source-scouring automated templates- due to the sheer scale of content involved in Crawl, and due to all of the out-of-date pages kept on this inactive wiki, having somebody remember to run a checklist of scripts is much more effective for providing up-to-date information than expecting people to update a pile of pages with each update. The wiki just needs new admins and a public regular checklist of scripts to run with new versions for new admins- I'm sure that if it's of minimal enough effort, some developers could be roped into this as part of the development version release routine.</dd>
<dd>Speaking as (sigh) one of the Crawl developers, the abandonment of the wiki has many traceable causes- including the amount of time and effort it takes to regularly update the wiki, the constant presence of out-of-date information, and the absence of regular contributors. Automated template scripts can dramatically assist in these areas, with proper maintenance. Other issues like the historical problems with making new accounts, the omni-presence of advice that presumes much of the player and is out of tune with the community's optimizing elite, and the tendency for page updates to be rather selective in their output. This medium is still substantially more suited to in-depth explanations than the learndb, and providing a centralized repository of such detailed information can be helpful for even development if we provided sufficient care to the lot. --<a href="/User:Tower" title="User:Tower">Tower</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Tower" title="User talk:Tower">talk</a>) 20:43, 16 October 2016 (CEST)</dd></dl>

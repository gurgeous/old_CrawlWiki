<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="So.2C_what_do_gargoyles_have_to_offer.3F">So, what do gargoyles have to offer?</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Species_Mutations">Species Mutations</span></h3>
<p>In terms of special passive bonuses, gargoyles receive a ridiculous number of useful ones free of charge. Like the <a href="/Undead" title="Undead">undead</a> species, they come with complete <a href="/Poison" title="Poison">poison</a> immunity, a helpful trait throughout the game. Although near useless early on, they also come with <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> resistance, immunity to <a href="/Rot" title="Rot">rot</a> and <a href="/Petrification" title="Petrification" class="mw-redirect">petrification</a>, no need to breathe (providing immunity to gas attacks and reduced drowning damage), and partial <a href="/Torment" title="Torment">torment</a> resistance (reducing the damage taken by 50%). All of these are extremely helpful at one point or another throughout the game.
</p><p>They enjoy a single rank of <a href="/Slow_Metabolism" title="Slow Metabolism">Slow Metabolism</a>, which isn't really critical but is convenient all the same. At level 14, they gain the ability to <a href="/Fly" title="Fly">fly</a> indefinitely, providing a bonus to <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">stealth</a> and immunity to many kinds of <a href="/Traps" title="Traps">traps</a>. One rank of <a href="/Fangs" title="Fangs">Fangs</a> and two of <a href="/Talons" title="Talons">Talons</a> gives them a bit more capacity for murder in melee. Finally and most importantly, gargoyles get a massive boost to <a href="/AC" title="AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> (+2 at XL 1, gradually rising to +20 at XL 27) <i>and</i> <a href="/GDR" title="GDR" class="mw-redirect">GDR</a>, granting tremendous boosts to durability in melee. This also makes flight around <a href="/Airstrike" title="Airstrike">Airstrike</a>-using opponents significantly less risky, as that spell's damage is heavily reduced by AC (though you should probably land when they're around just to be safe).
</p><p>All of these boons do come at a cost, however. Gargoyles receive 20% less <a href="/HP" title="HP" class="mw-redirect">HP</a> than average, and are the only <a href="/Species" title="Species">species</a> that comes with vulnerability to <a href="/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction" title="Lee's Rapid Deconstruction">Lee's Rapid Deconstruction</a> and <a href="/Shatter" title="Shatter">Shatter</a>.
</p><p>Gargoyles have naturally high <a href="/Strength" title="Strength">strength</a>, decent <a href="/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a>, and below-average <a href="/Dexterity" title="Dexterity">dexterity</a>. Every four levels they gain a random boost to strength or intelligence.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Skill_Aptitudes">Skill Aptitudes</span></h2>
<p>Gargoyles don't have very many extremes when it comes to their skill aptitudes, allowing you a fair degree of leeway when it comes to developing your character. In terms of melee weapons, they receive a +1 to <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a>, <a href="/Maces_%26_Flails" title="Maces &amp; Flails">Maces &amp; Flails</a>, <a href="/Staves" title="Staves">Staves</a>, and <a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a>, while everything else suffers a -1. This isn't enough to chase you away from letting a fantastic <a href="/Randart" title="Randart">randart</a> <a href="/Long_sword" title="Long sword">long sword</a> or <a href="/Battleaxe" title="Battleaxe">battleaxe</a> determine your skill choice for the game, but both M&amp;F and UC are easy to get access to early on, will level a bit faster than the other options, and are solid choices throughout the game, though bear in mind that a gargoyle's weak <a href="/Transmutations" title="Transmutations">Transmutations</a> skill makes UC a little less appealing than normal.
</p><p>Defensively, gargoyles get a pretty nice hand as well. <a href="/Armour_(skill)" title="Armour (skill)">Armour</a> and <a href="/Shields_(skill)" title="Shields (skill)">Shields</a> receive a +1, while <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a> receives +2. Unfortunately, their <a href="/Dodge" title="Dodge" class="mw-redirect">Dodge</a> skill is at -2, and this is one of the few areas where their stone anatomy doesn't provide much help.
</p><p>Gargoyles have a decent set of magical options available. They receive +1 in <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> and +2 in <a href="/Earth_Magic" title="Earth Magic">Earth Magic</a>, which makes that a tempting choice. <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a> and <a href="/Ice_Magic" title="Ice Magic">Ice Magic</a> receive tolerable +0's, making them reasonable choices too, while <a href="/Air_Magic" title="Air Magic">Air Magic</a> gets an irritating -2. All other schools of magic are at -1 or -2, making them possible but not exactly ideal to specialize in.
</p><p>Finally, ranged weapons are almost entirely +0, except for <a href="/Slings" title="Slings">Slings</a> with a -1. There's nothing stopping you from playing a ranged weapon user gargoyle, but the combination of +1 in Conjuration, naturally low dexterity, and a gargoyle's innate incentive to wear light or medium armour make ranged weapons a little redundant when magic's an option. Consider ranged weapons only as a crutch in the early game that you don't invest much XP into, a useful side weapon when worshiping <a href="/Trog" title="Trog">Trog</a>, or if you find an amazing <a href="/Artefact" title="Artefact">artefact</a> <a href="/Longbow" title="Longbow">longbow</a> early on that makes the path worthwhile.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Gargoyle_Hybrid_Build">The Gargoyle Hybrid Build</span></h2>
<p>When all of this is taken together, there is absolutely no reason (barring Trog) not to play a gargoyle as a melee tank who thrashes opponents that get close and magically blasts anything far off. So long as you can survive the somewhat dicey early game while your skin is still turning to adamantium and your HP pool is barely in the double digits, this build should carry you through to the <a href="/Orb_of_Zot" title="Orb of Zot">Orb of Zot</a> in as much safety as you can ever find in <i>Crawl</i>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Unique_Strengths_and_Weaknesses">Unique Strengths and Weaknesses</span></h3>
<p>Gargoyle traits make certain major threats in the game negligible, but also make some fairly average opponents suddenly much more dangerous. Once you've gotten yourself settled into a decent medium armour, a gargoyle can go toe-to-toe with any non-<a href="/Out-of-depth" title="Out-of-depth">out-of-depth</a> opponent with ease. While <a href="/Constriction" title="Constriction">constriction</a> normally cuts through even heavy armour fairly well, gargoyles have such absurdly high AC that it barely affects them. Coupled with poison immunity, this makes the <a href="/Spider%27s_Nest" title="Spider's Nest">Spider's Nest</a> and <a href="/Snake_Pit" title="Snake Pit">Snake Pit</a> both significantly easier than normal.
</p><p>Torment resistance is amazingly helpful in the extended game, rendering the deadliest <a href="/Demon" title="Demon">demons</a> much more survivable. With rot immunity as well, that cuts out the worst of the <a href="/Death_curse" title="Death curse">death curses</a> you'll come across when taking down <a href="/Undead#Mummies" title="Undead">mummies</a>. <a href="/The_Tomb" title="The Tomb">The Tomb</a>, <a href="/Pandemonium" title="Pandemonium">Pandemonium</a>, and the <a href="/Hell" title="Hell">Hells</a> are all much easier than normal as a result, especially if you have a source of <a href="/Negative_energy" title="Negative energy">negative energy</a> resistance as well.
</p><p>What gargoyles do need to worry about are enemies with ranged weapons (these ignore GDR, and while your AC will soften their impact, it's not exactly reliable) and enemies with the three guaranteed damage sources you aren't resistant to: <a href="/Smiting" title="Smiting">smiting</a>, <a href="/Hellfire" title="Hellfire">hellfire</a>, and <a href="/Earth_Magic" title="Earth Magic">Earth Magic</a>. Early on, overconfidence with <a href="/Orc_priest" title="Orc priest">orc priests</a> around can get you killed very quickly, and even in the late game smiting can be unpleasant. Hellfire is going to be brutal no matter what; a <a href="/Hellion" title="Hellion">hellion</a>, <a href="/Balrug" title="Balrug">balrug</a>, <a href="/Brimstone_fiend" title="Brimstone fiend">brimstone fiend</a>, <a href="/Hell_sentinel" title="Hell sentinel">hell sentinel</a>, or <a href="/Draconian_scorcher" title="Draconian scorcher">draconian scorcher</a> can easily land heavy hits upon you. While these threats are dangerous to all players, playing a gargoyle can easily lull you into a sense of security. You are not invincible, no matter what that long stream of corpses behind you may suggest.
</p><p>The threat that other characters don't normally need to worry about is enemy earth mages. <a href="/Shatter" title="Shatter">Shatter</a> and <a href="/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction" title="Lee's Rapid Deconstruction">Lee's Rapid Deconstruction</a> can decimate you if you allow them to, and there's little you can do to counter them. If you encounter <a href="/Jorgrun" title="Jorgrun">Jorgrun</a>, immediately begin <a href="/Fly" title="Fly">flying</a> to reduce the damage from Shatter to a fraction of its potential strength. When <a href="/Deep_troll_earth_mage" title="Deep troll earth mage">deep troll earth mages</a> start appearing, do whatever you can to close the gap to melee quickly; at range, they'll blast you to pieces with <a href="/Smite" title="Smite" class="mw-redirect">smite</a>-targeted accuracy.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stat_Points">Stat Points</span></h3>
<p>Regardless of your background, you'll likely want to put the lion's share of your stat points into intelligence. Any background except for casters will have enough strength to wear the medium dragon armours comfortably right from the get-go, and you randomly gain strength as you level anyway; consider taking a couple points in strength only if you're playing a caster and want to guarantee that you'll be able to wear a <a href="/Fire_dragon_armour" title="Fire dragon armour">fire dragon armour</a>, <a href="/Ice_dragon_armour" title="Ice dragon armour">ice dragon armour</a>, or <a href="/Pearl_dragon_armour" title="Pearl dragon armour">pearl dragon armour</a> when you find or create one. Dexterity's boost to <a href="/Ev" title="Ev" class="mw-redirect">evasion</a> is significant, and requires no micromanagement, but it's less dramatic than the benefits to your offensive and utility magic you'll get from intelligence. Once you've gotten your level 6 spells castable, switching to dexterity boosting is perfectly valid.
</p><p>If you'd like to ignore spellcasting entirely, however, you can focus on pumping strength alone in order to make the super-heavy armours (<a href="/Gold_dragon_armour" title="Gold dragon armour">gold dragon armour</a> and <a href="/Crystal_plate_mail" title="Crystal plate mail" class="mw-redirect">crystal plate mail</a>) wearable. Although this leaves you with almost no access to spells, it does result in an unparalleled amount of physical defense. How worthwhile this actually is is really up to you.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Equipment">Equipment</span></h3>
<p>With their fairly minimal variation between skills, any melee weapon school will do. By the mid-game, gargoyles usually have enough durability to survive a little reckless cleaving with <a href="/Axes" title="Axes">Axes</a>, and they do get slightly faster leveling from both <a href="/Maces_%26_Flails" title="Maces &amp; Flails">Maces &amp; Flails</a> and <a href="/Unarmed_Combat" title="Unarmed Combat">Unarmed Combat</a>, but your choice can be safely based on the first solid weapon you come across. Just don't go too long waiting for something exceptional to pop up; you'll be doing a decent amount of melee this game, and you'll want to be competent at it quickly.
</p><p>You should eventually grab a dragon armour by the mid- or late-game, but early on that won't be an option. If you're playing a caster background, grab nothing heavier than <a href="/Ring_mail" title="Ring mail">ring mail</a>; you'll want those starter spells functional to help keep you alive while you're at your most vulnerable. Characters without spells in the beginning should instead take advantage of the heaviest armours they can find; while even light armour will provide excellent GDR for gargoyles, GDR is useless if you don't have the AC to back it up. Try to pile it on from as many sources as you can while you're still soft and tender.
</p><p>Once you've gotten some levels under your belt and you're no longer quite as vulnerable to <a href="/Orc_priest" title="Orc priest">orc priest</a> <a href="/Smiting" title="Smiting">smiting</a>, take advantage of any decent artefact armours you find along the way. Getting yourself a rank of <a href="/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a> and <a href="/Cold" title="Cold">cold</a> resistance will give you protection against every element you're likely to encounter until you take on the <a href="/Slime_Pits" title="Slime Pits" class="mw-redirect">Slime Pits</a>. If you come across a <a href="/Mottled_dragon_hide" title="Mottled dragon hide">mottled dragon hide</a>, strongly consider pouring your <a href="/Scrolls_of_enchant_armour" title="Scrolls of enchant armour" class="mw-redirect">scrolls of enchant armour</a> into that; a gargoyle in <a href="/Mottled_dragon_armour" title="Mottled dragon armour">mottled dragon armour</a> will be capable of soaking damage as though it were <a href="/Plate_armour" title="Plate armour">plate armour</a> while dodging and casting spells with no difficulty. <a href="/Fire_dragon_armour" title="Fire dragon armour">Fire dragon armour</a> and <a href="/Ice_dragon_armour" title="Ice dragon armour">ice dragon armour</a> are also good choices if you need to fill a particular resistance (consider switching out for them when raiding <a href="/Gehenna" title="Gehenna">Gehenna</a> or <a href="/Cocytus" title="Cocytus">Cocytus</a>), while <a href="/Pearl_dragon_armour" title="Pearl dragon armour">pearl dragon armour</a> will render you ridiculously well-protected. Even with their low HP, a well-dressed gargoyle is nearly unstoppable in melee once it matures enough.
</p><p>Wearing a shield isn't especially necessary for a gargoyle. While they are fairly talented at the Shields skill, they already have absurd durability, the benefits of wielding a two-handed weapon are significant, and the experience spent training the skill could be put to use elsewhere. Consider it if you find a fantastic artifact shield, but otherwise you can manage without them.
</p><p>While there's no particular jewelry you <i>need</i> to find for this build, consider taking advantage of an <a href="/Amulet_of_guardian_spirit" title="Amulet of guardian spirit">amulet of guardian spirit</a> or any artefact with <a href="/Spirit_shield" title="Spirit shield">spirit shield</a> on it if you find one. The added durability this offers will offset the HP penalty you suffer, which can be tremendously useful early on. Don't be afraid to swap it out for another <a href="/Amulet" title="Amulet">amulet</a> if the need arises.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gods">Gods</span></h3>
<p>There really aren't many restrictions on which god to worship here, apart from <a href="/Yredelemnul" title="Yredelemnul">Yredelemnul</a>. Due to your non-living nature, Yred simply will not accept your worship. Choose your god based on your background and which useful god you find first. Magical blasters can overcome their mediocre intelligence through <a href="/Vehumet" title="Vehumet">Vehumet</a>'s passive gifts. Melee tanks can get access to very useful allies, healing, and elemental ranged attacks through <a href="/Makhleb" title="Makhleb">Makhleb</a>. <a href="/Okawaru" title="Okawaru">Okawaru</a> and <a href="/Trog" title="Trog">Trog</a> are as reliable as they ever are, piling you up with gift <a href="/Acquirement" title="Acquirement">acquirements</a> and providing helpful combat abilities. The only two gods that really don't provide much support with this build would be <a href="/Zin" title="Zin">Zin</a> (your innate resistances overlap some of the more useful resistances he provides) and <a href="/Sif_Muna" title="Sif Muna">Sif Muna</a> (you aren't really rushing to find any particular high level spells, so the book gifts aren't critical; Vehumet's gift spells are usually useful enough).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Skills">Skills</span></h3>
<p>Gargoyles need all the HP they can get to survive the few sources of guaranteed damage they'll run into over the course of the game, and since you're ideally going to be in melee most of the time you'll want solid melee skills, so turn on <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a> from the very start and leave it on. The benefits are minor initially, but it adds up over time and every little bit helps. Once you've selected a melee weapon, start training its skill as well until it hits its minimum delay. At that point, shut it down and focus Fighting.
</p><p>You can safely ignore <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> for the most part; gargoyles have a slow metabolism and you can generally find enough <a href="/Chunk" title="Chunk">chunks</a> to keep you well fed throughout the game. Train it a bit if you need more spell levels or to reduce the failure chance of a spell you want online quickly, but don't pour too much experience into this. Instead, you'll want to train up <a href="/Conjurations" title="Conjurations">Conjurations</a> and one elemental magic school once you've gotten access to it. <a href="/Earth_Magic" title="Earth Magic">Earth Magic</a> is a gargoyle's obvious strong suit, with <a href="/Lee%27s_Rapid_Deconstruction" title="Lee's Rapid Deconstruction">Lee's Rapid Deconstruction</a> and <a href="/Iron_Shot" title="Iron Shot">Iron Shot</a> providing very heavy damage output once you get them online. <a href="/Fire_Magic" title="Fire Magic">Fire Magic</a> also works very well. <a href="/Conjure_Flame" title="Conjure Flame">Conjure Flame</a> and <a href="/Sticky_Flame" title="Sticky Flame">Sticky Flame</a> both combo nicely with melee attacks, allowing you to roast difficult opponents as you beat them into submission.
</p><p>Only level up <a href="/Armour_(skill)" title="Armour (skill)">Armour</a> enough that it doesn't interfere with your spells heavily; once you've gotten your spells online, you can turn it off safely. A few more points of AC aren't going to make or break your character. If you decide to use a shield, get it up to 5 for <a href="/Buckler" title="Buckler">bucklers</a> or 15 for <a href="/Shield" title="Shield">shields</a>. You likely won't want to make the experience investment for a <a href="/Large_shield" title="Large shield">large shield</a>. <a href="/Dodge" title="Dodge" class="mw-redirect">Dodge</a> is a pain to train with the -2 aptitude penalty, but it's worthwhile; coupling your immense durability with a large chance of the enemy simply missing its attacks lets you plow through fights without resting, and it provides a means of defending against ranged weapon attacks. Once you've got your basic offense online, a few levels in <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a> don't hurt either. Being able to back away from a <a href="/Unique" title="Unique" class="mw-redirect">unique</a> you aren't ready for makes a lot of difference toward survival.

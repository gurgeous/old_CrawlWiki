<li>+0 serpent of hell armour (11 ac -4 evap) {rF+ rC+ rN+}</li>
<li>level 8 spell of bookcasting, only granted by sif, animates a given number of books and lets you cast spells from them in the same turn (with doubled spell hunger cost and still mp cost), but gives div miscast if a book is knocked down and each book has an mp pool like rods</li>
<li>to make inner flame less mediocre due to distance, introduce level 4 hex/fire Heat Wave, which checks mr to lower speed, attack, ev, and sh, but check hd if the monster has inner flame, sticky flame, or is standing in conjured flame</li>
<li>summon storm! level 9 conjurations/summonings, summon/conjures smite-style completely randomized summons surrounding of tons of enemies to surround all those concievably hit, but only last until your next action; instantly shoots up vehumet piety to 6*</li>
<li>Deafness.</li>
<li>Orb of fire unique!</li>
<li>much like how piety has increasing chances to block against tso's cleansing flames on angel/daeva kills, increasing degrees of piety neutralize smiting attacks</li>

<li>level 9 hex that automatically without fail stabs everything in los, but is done by stabbing yourself</li>
<li>portal volcano: lvl 7 fire/tloc, sort of like malign gateway but a: aphysxiating los-blocking ash clouds and b: randomly throws out bolts of magma, fireballs, and said aphysxiating clouds from the portal location instead of an eldritch tentacle</li>
<li>what's with this player/monster discrepancy? give HOPrs at 6* rHellfire, minor healing, and summon demon invocations, like orc high priests have</li>
<li>if polymorph other fails to hit due to rMut, it stills inflicts a single pip of glow</li>
<li>henzell and gretell report that deep dwarves got a god instead of makhleb, because they'll always be joining him anyway</li>
<li>LRDability of a monster is determined by detecting skeletalness of its tile.</li>
<li>since fire is currently regarded as the weakest element, take a page from earth's connection to transmutations and air's connection to charms plus take some inspiration from the most surely infamous fire unique, asmodeus, and start making fire/tloc spells</li>
<li>allow stealing from shops, but have 9 perma-hasted perma-summoned un-abjurable speed 50 executioners spawn when one does so</li>
<li>Nemelex Xobeh ****** ability: 52 pickup</li>
<li>yaktaur unique, comes with a chaos crossbow and casts portal projectile. hope you've got rEverything!</li>
<li>to respect proper folklore, monster vampires are distracted when one drops a stack of over 50 items</li>
<li>let's take ideas from the absolutely dead serious roguelikes; combine executioners with rock worms</li>
<li>composed body mutation: first level rSickness, second level one pip of SustAb, third level rRot</li>
<li>sp stands for spoon, not spriggan</li>
<li>lvl 9 hex: ghastly malnevolence: conjures a being of pure hatred that swaps all hex effects on the player to a random enemy on screen and all charms effects on monsters to the player</li>
<li>eyes storm</li>
<li>tukima's firing range: smite-animates ranged weapon and/or missile stack to remote-fire, damage/speed is half power, half skill. uses: avoid armour/shield/form disabilities, different angles, use large rocks and other junk laying around</li>
<li>promising to code bad_ideas if one can come up with a really, really catchy name for them</li>
<li>really annoying, fast unique with fire, ice, corrosion, and vampiric attacks that flees often and casts teleport other often; also follows player across d levels after first sighting</li>
<li>unique with vampiric attacks (maybe a chupacabra?) that attacks other enemies to heal</li>
<li>&lt;valrus&gt; fr: give olgreb a duration [Implemented]</li>
<li>the unique room in sprint III with joseph and jozef or sigmund and edmund is silly when it has frances and wiglaf in it, their names don't even sound similar! put boris and norris in there instead
<dl><dd> from the most difficult roguelike in existence, more monsters! monsters that attack you from anywhere on the floor, monsters that when dead heal other monsters, monsters that'd shoot poison arrows from across the floor, executionerrockworms, and jellies that eat egos</dd></dl></li>
<li>and of course the best of monsters from that game, the monster with smite-targeted "make player do almost any action possible" spells that repeats itself for hundreds of turns at a time</li>
<li>magic dart of dispersal</li>
<li>ballistamyctaurs! weild hand ballistas (only otherwise weildable by ogres, trolls) that fire entire stacks of bolts at once, armed ones explode when killed into a bunch of unarmed ballistamyctaurs, slow movement</li>
<li>mummy curses can affect your bootknife</li>
<li>charms/conjurations spell: zelda-esque sword beams!</li>
<li>charms/summonings spell: reverse abjuration; lengthens a given summon's duration and heals it very slightly, but lowers in effectiveness with each successive cast</li>
<li>Being [Hanged_Man] and not coding anything</li>
<li>trying to come up with the fastest and most efficient way to delete random bad ideas</li>
<li>hexecutioners! cast invisibility, confuse, and sleep alongside haste and pain</li>
<li>mandrakes! if you're not stealthy or fast enough to kill them before they wake, they scream as loud as an alarm trap, paralyze you with the volume, then teleport away as off-screen enemies come in to investigate the noise</li>
<li>Chaos knights start with weapons of chaos</li>
<li>exploding nets</li>

<li>unique that both mesmerizes and causes fear, ideally getting a player to be unable to move</li>
<li>guard the inside of the temple with some sort of construct, like sprint III. the flavour can be that it's preventing altar desecration!</li>
<li>if said temple has been corrupted, the construct inside is even slower then usual but has distortion-branded hits</li>
<li>while golems can be quite the interesting aggravations with their rediculous resists and defenses, they're usually a distraction at best. replace some of them with statue-formed character races, so that they really hit like a ton of bricks and can cast some form of spells too</li>
<li>while it's appropiate that tomb has plenty of traps, it's boring for them all to be standard traps: add in better cliche ones, like shafts that rop you to hatch-connected-only anaconda pits, use the new boulder-beetle-that-dashes-like-a-boulder in corridors, and have some statues suddenly become archer statues when the rune's picked up</li>
<li>natural form: turns centaurs into horses, merfolk into fish, naga into snakes, kobolds into rodents, draconians into dragons, and demonspawn into demons</li>
<li>break the new skills system code in half just so that wizmode can ramp up earth to 255 and cast floor-wide shatter over and over again, again</li>
<li>forget messing around with hexes to make arcane marksmen more interesting, just give them a book with apportation, blink, portal projectile, swiftness, poison weapon, and control teleport</li>
<li>to make sif more like the anti-trog, sif is pleased when you kill any intelligent monster that doesn't have spells</li>
<li>A branch where there are no staircases, just hatches</li>
<li>let the devs offer one free idea implementation to the person who cleans up every outdated reference to trunk or old version presumptions in the learndb</li>
<li>adding bad_ideas specifically to annoy those who want to see bad_ideas removed</li>
<li>removing bad_ideas specifically to annoy those who don't want bad_ideas removed</li>
<li>adding more and more entries in reference to the current state of bad_ideas just to artifically inflate the entry count</li>
<li>mercenary background</li>
<li>throwing daggers at sleeping monsters causes ranged stabs!!!</li>
<li>reading a scroll of vorpalize weapon while weilding a stack of missiles turns them into steel missiles</li>
<li>elven, orcish, and dwarven dragons</li>
<li>If you've gotten fifteen runes and escape with the orb, you find out that an infinite ziggurat has built itself ontop of the dungeon and may go on for as long as you like</li>
<li>make mnoleg a demonic octopode, give him eight different attacks with eight different brands</li>
<li>the temporary statboost potions are boring! make them potions of temporary halflingness, deep-elvishness, and trolling instead</li>
<li>in sprint III, roxanne is randomly replaced with a diamond obelisk</li>
<li>a unique with pointedly high resists and ac who casts borg's whenever low on health: only killable after it casts it enough times you can one-shot it safely</li>
<li>to make the snake pits more pit like, there are tons of shafts and only hatches upwards, no staircases</li>
<li>zot defence sprint</li>
<li>chei is annoyed when you employ allies that are faster then normal speed</li>
<li>A race that has permanent haste, might and mesmerise</li>
<li>ever bringing up what "difficulty" means in relation to two differing parts of crawl</li>
<li>ouroborus unique: always ressurects itself when killed (infinity symbol!), fast but is weak, doesn't leave the level it spawns on, only gives experience once</li>
<li>mothman unique: fast as bats, teleports away on sight and stalks like a wandering mushroom until you reach 50% health so as to swoop in and hit hard with vampiric attacks</li>
<li>the learnaean hydra still isn't enough; implement anata, the snake with a thousand heads</li>
<li>chaos dragons: have chaos branded claws, seething chaos breath, randomly invisibly change resistances like tiamat, provide randart dragon armours when skinned. worshipping xom lets you summon them with summon dragon!</li>
<li>nerf paralyze at least slightly by preserving all statuses besides paralysis at their duration at the moment of paralysis</li>
<li>change all sources of paralyze to petrify</li>
<li>yaktaurs and centaurs are a lot of pressure on the average earlyearly character: introduce easy, earlier ranged packs, with sheeptaurs, which have slings, rattaurs, which have darts, and newttaurs, which just throw stones</li>
<li>since grey draconians are breathless, let them recite as long as they want!</li>
<li>level 9 charms: lifesaving; is always on once learned and cannot be forgotten, disappears once used and can never be memorized again</li>

<li>the defining feature of early basic imps is their fast regen: give fast regen to that infamous imp unique, asmodeus</li>
<li>remove hive, up bee room spawning rate to triple of current rate</li>
<li>Your body is rather/quite/extremely receptive to outside augmentation and detriment: increases all non-natural stat increases by 1 for each 4/3/2 outside boosts to a stat, increases all outside stat draining by 1, extends duration of both good and bad effects on self</li>
<li>Felid deaths leave player ghosts in addition to corpses</li>
<li>abyssal zigs, where each level is an abyss with 10x spawning rate flavoured around a given zig level and each exit out (where the loot is naturally, of course) sends you to the next abyssal zig floor</li>
<li>tornado effects the path of missiles, making most monster shots miss you and force you to learn how to whip around your own missiles to make them hit the right enemies</li>
<li>level 9 conjurations spell: bolt of venomous icy firey draining lightning</li>
<li>level 6 necromancy/poison: ring of miasma</li>
<li>level&#160;?? charms: absorption: allows you to take in a given weapon/armour's brands/resists/whatever while using any other weapon/armour, very short duration</li>
<li>Food and cooking god: likes it when you use special cooking invocations with potions (sauces), select chunks and permafood to make delicious perma-food consumed for plenty of long-lasting buffs. Wrath rots all of your cooked food, spams hungry ghosts, and gives the equivalent of fast metabolism 3.</li>
<li>N78291: guess I'm off to pan with my starting spells + rmsl</li>
<li>Add a&#160;!shoot command that simulates Russian Roulette (without the actual death part, just a kick)</li>
<li>water on zot:5 with submerging orb guardians</li>
<li>necromancy spell, horrorshow: smite-animates a corpse with demented spirits who disgustingly twist it into a macabre grotesquery, which casts mass confusion, fear, and paralyze through mutilating itself (doesn't effect mindless, J, G, x/X, hexes are much stronger if corpse is same genus). the fun of animated corpses, without any experience drain!</li>
<li>wanderer buff: always starts with 1 in every skill</li>
<li>anti-knowledge brand: makes you randomly forget things when hit</li>
<li>replace dragon form with mythical form: draconians still become dragons, but demonspawn become demons, octopodes become krakens, and kenku become rocs!</li>
<li>see {xom_ideas[202]}</li>
<li>level 12 earth spell: conjure labrynth</li>
<li>when you're poisoned by a summon, abjuration will also abjure away the poison</li>
<li>shattering sprint III's crypt</li>
<li>&lt;jle&gt; We also need vice beasts, clearly, for Hell. &lt;[Hanged_Man]&gt; vice beasts make you jealous &lt;[Hanged_Man]&gt; of other people's chars &lt;ontoclasm1&gt; The Hell Beast yells, "paplaukes's last OpHe had rF+++ by Lair"</li>
<li>floating hearts wtih their arteries and veins still attached: fast and have corrosive, vampiric, and highly sickness-inducing attacks, but are weak and lose max hp on each action; also, they leave a blood trail. crawl needs more things to keep people up at night!</li>
<li>to make feature mimics a threat, theme them like ugly things and have them teleport away when low on health: weapon shop mimics summon dancing weapons, armour shop mimics have lots of ac, book shop mimics hurl spells, and food shop mimics eat your food</li>

<li>firestorm crabs</li>

<li>level 9 translocations covering the rather odd lack of representation for teleporting others as opposed to one's self: dimensional transference; hit a storm-radius area with special translocation energy clouds, second cast hits another storm area and irresistably randomly dumps those hit in the second cast in the area of the first cast</li>
<li>give statue form and dragon form rTrample</li>
<li>charms/transmutations spell that converts polymorph spells into pips of glowtamination, gives random stat boosts with each pip of glow, gives random brilliance/might/agility at yellow glow and all three at red glow, and makes glow last longer</li>
<li>hellyfish: have irresistable paralyzing melee, because cocytus waters are currently boring aside from bolt of cold interaction</li>
<li>hatching down to orc:4</li>
<li>chei ability: keep any spell in reserve as "delayed x"</li>
<li>asmodeus is too wimpy, swap his bolt of fire for bolt of magma, give him sticky flame on hit, and explode with with inner flames on death</li>

<li>Use Trog's Burn books-ability to cause a firestorm from a book shop.</li>
<li>instead of hearing coins counted for on-level temporary portals to bazaars, you get to watch commericals</li>
<li>unrandart The Ring of Utilty {+Inv +Rage +Blink +Lev}</li>
<li>unrandart The One Ring {Hunger AC+1 EV+1 Str+1 Dex+1 Int+1 Acc+1 Dam+1 MP+1}</li>

<li>combine staff of channeling, energy, wizardry, and power</li>
<li>343 (L1 TrBe) became a worshipper of Cheibriados. (D:1)</li>

<li>mikee</li>
<li>Spell memorization failure</li>
<li>megabat unique with 1000 hp, 50 ac/ev, has all resistances, tracks you down when you teleport</li>

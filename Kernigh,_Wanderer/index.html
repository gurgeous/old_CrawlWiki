</p><p>I lost my grey elf at the end of my last diary, <a href="/Kernigh,_Ice_Elementalist" title="Kernigh, Ice Elementalist">Kernigh, Ice Elementalist</a>. So, I am starting a new game with a random species and class. The game provided me with a Demigod Wanderer.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wandering_into_the_Dungeon">Wandering into the Dungeon</span></h2>
<p><i>Welcome, Kernigh the Demigod Wanderer. You wake up in a daze, and can't recall much.</i> That message about the daze, suggests that my demigod should immediately climb the staircase and leave the dungeon; but I do not intend to immediately abort a new game of Crawl.
</p><p>Wanderers start the game with random skills; the Crawl manual describes them as a challenge. The manual also warns that non-humans may start with skills at below level one. I notice that while a <a href="/Human" title="Human">human</a> has an aptitude of 100 in most skills, a <a href="/Demigod" title="Demigod">demigod</a> has an aptitude of 100. When I press 'm' to check my demigod's skills, I see only Darts at Skill 1 (%70).
</p><p>Yet I have no darts; my demigod's inventory contains only a +0,+0 spear (weapon), a +0 ring mail (worn) and a bread ration. My demigod also has 13/13 hp, 2/2 magic, and attributes of strength 19, intelligence 10, dexterity 13.
</p><p>My demigod arrives in a room with granite statues. It opens the first door and proceeds to explore dungeon level 1. The first hostile monster is a <a href="/Hobgoblin" title="Hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> wieldin an orcish <a href="/Club" title="Club">club</a>. I let the hobgoblin move adjacent. <i>You hit the hobgoblin. The hogoblin is moderately wounded. The hobgoblin hits you with an orcish club.</i> My demigod have hp 12/13. <i>You miss the hobgoblin. The hobgoblin hits you with an orcish club.</i> My demigod has hp 8/13. My demigod flees into the room of the statues. <i>You have gained Armour skill!</i> The hobgoblin chases my demigod around a statue; the hobgoblin frequently forces my demigod to switch between counterclockwise and clockwise movement. A statue apparently acts an obstacle to movement, but my character may see across a pillar, unlike a statue. Because of this distraction, I fail to notice when my demigod reaches 13/13 hp, but that happens before I accidentally resume melee with the hobgoblin. <i>You hit the hobgoblin, but do no damage. The hobgoblin misses you. </i>You hit the hobgoblin. You have gained Polearms skill! You kill the hobgoblin!
</p><p>My demigod meets a second opponent, a <a href="/Kobold" title="Kobold">kobold</a> wielding a <a href="/Dagger" title="Dagger">dagger</a>. When I sighta second kobold (who <i>doesn't appear to have noticed you</i>), I instruct my demigod to begin retreating. I hope that the first kobold will follow but that the second kobold will stay out of the battle. This seems to work. My demigod turns the corner that leads toward the room of statues, and begins to melee the kobold. <i>You hit the kobold, but do no damage. The kobold hits you but doesn't do any damage. You hit the kobold. The kobold is heavily wounded. The kobold hits you with a dagger.</i> Have hp 12/13. <i>You hit the kobold. You kill the kobold!</i>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I encounter a <a href="/Giant_gecko" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant gecko">giant gecko</a>. I try to run away, but the giant gecko moves faster and bites. As my demigod's hp falls to 2/13, I reach an escape hatch. <i>Are you sure you want to leave the Dungeon?</i> I have no better option but to reply yes. <i>You have escaped!</i>
</p>

<p>Because I already started a "Kernigh, Wanderer" diary, and because my game was so short, I now start another Demigod Wanderer.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skirmishes_of_Level_1">Skirmishes of Level 1</span></h2>
<p>My demigod, "Kernigh the Disarmer", has two skills, Armour at Skill 1 (70%) and Traps &amp; Dooors at Skill 1 (70%). My demigod also has a more substantial inventory, containing a +0,+0 <a href="/Spear" title="Spear">spear</a>, a +0 <a href="/Robe" title="Robe">robe</a>, a +0 <a href="/Gloves" title="Gloves">pair of gloves</a>, a <a href="/Bread_ration" class="mw-redirect" title="Bread ration">bread ration</a>, a <a href="/Potion_of_speed" class="mw-redirect" title="Potion of speed">potion of speed</a>.
</p><p>My demigod arrives in a room with a pile of gold, and four doors. I instruct my demigod to take the gold and exit through the southern door. This reveals a corridor with more doors. The map gradually reveals more doors and more upward staircases.
</p><p>My first opponent is a <a href="/Giant_bat" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant bat">giant bat</a>. When I see the bat, I step my demigod away. <i>The giant bat hits you but doesn't do any damage. The giant bat hits you but doesn't do any damage. There is an open door here.</i> Now I begin to fight! <i>You miss the giant bat. The giant bat misses you. The giant bat misses you. You puncture the giant bat. You kill the giant bat!</i>
</p><p><a href="/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Kernigh-DGWn-level-1.jpg" class="new" title="File:Kernigh-DGWn-level-1.jpg">The map shows a group of three rooms, each with up staircase. The only way to explore further is to take the door that exits to the south.</a>
</p><p>Ultimately, I discover that the only exit from this set of doors and rooms is to the south. My demigod uses this exit and explores the remainder of dungeon level 1. I encounter a second giant bat; my demigod kills it with one hit. <i>You have gained Polearms skill!</i> One hit each also kills a <a href="/Rat" title="Rat">rat</a> and a <a href="/Giant_newt" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant newt">giant newt</a>. The battle against an <a href="/Ooze" title="Ooze">ooze</a> is more difficult. I use a short section of wall as the scene of the battle. The ooze flees the battle while my demigod rests on the other side of the wall.
</p><p>A third giant bat gives some trouble, because my demigod heavily wounds the giant bat but fails to kill the giant bat. I lose the giant bat around a corner, and my demigod rests. Then I return my demigod to that room and kill the giant bat.
</p><p>After defeating some other monsters, my demigod encounters a <a href="/Goblin" title="Goblin">goblin</a>. The battle seems okay until a hobgoblin unexpectedly flanks my demigod. Thus trapped between two monsters, my demigod tries to kill the goblin and flee. Luckily, the hobgoblin's attacks miss and my demigod kills the goblin, with 6/13 hp remaining to flee from the hobgoblin. The situation becomes worse when a <a href="/Kobold" title="Kobold">kobold</a> appears in the distance. My demigod flees across the dungeon, hoping to avoid another flanking situation. I establish a rectangular circuit for the hobgoblin and kobold to chase my demigod. The kobold eventually reverses direction in the circuit, but the flank fails, as my demigod changes direction. Then the almost-dead hobgoblin moves behind the kobold as the chase continues.
</p><p>After my demigod kills the kobold, it kills the almost-dead hobgoblin, before the ooze (that now reappears) moves into melee range. Soon my demigod reaches "Very Hungry" status; meanwhile a <a href="/Worm" title="Worm">worm</a> also appears. Then a <a href="/Rat" title="Rat">rat</a> appears; my demigod takes its corpse, grabs an elven dagger and flees to eat a chunk of rat meat, which returns my demigod to "Hungry" status. Then it finds and kills the worm, but it loses the ooze. As it continues to explore the level, it defeats some other monsters. When I again locate the ooze, my demigod finally kills it.
</p><p>After I sight a <a href="/Giant_gecko" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant gecko">giant gecko</a>, I direct my demigod to the down staircase. I have explored most but not all of dungeon level 1, but I feel not ready to fight a giant gecko. My demigod defeats a giant bat and a goblin at dungeon level 2, before I save my game.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chatter_2">Chatter</span></h3>
<p>It seems that sometimes, to avoid a particular monster, I should go down &gt; and skip to the next dungeon level. --<a href="/index.php?title=User:Kernigh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kernigh (page does not exist)">Kernigh</a> 20:47, 1 March 2008 (MST)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ijyb_has_a_wand_of_draining.21">Ijyb has a wand of draining!</span></h2>
<p>Today is 3 March 2008.
</p><p>Now that I have more confidence, I may stop noting every encounter with every monster in this diary, as my demigod wanders dungeon level 2.
</p><p>When my demigod becomes hungry, my demigod acquire sickness from a chunk of <a href="/Hobgoblin" title="Hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> meat; but its health soon improves. I instruct my demigod to eat a second chunk of hobgoblin meat from a different <a href="/Corpse" title="Corpse">corpse</a>. <i>You feel ill.</i> Again. My demigod finds nutrition in a chunk of <a href="/Rat" title="Rat">rat</a> meat.
</p><p><i>You enter a teleport trap!</i> But there are no bad consequences; the trap luckily took me from an unexplored part of dungeon level 2 to an unexplored part.
</p><p><i>Ijyb zaps a wand. The bolt of negative energy hits you! You feel drained.</i> <a href="/Ijyb" title="Ijyb">Ijyb</a> surprises my demigod, and suddenly it becomes very necessary to flee this level. My demigod takes one more hit from the <a href="/Wand_of_draining" title="Wand of draining">wand of draining</a> before I escape behind a corner with 3/24 hp. I desperately instruct my demigod to quaff one of its three green potions. <i>You feel much better.</i> I hoped for a potion of curing. The green potion is a <a href="/Potion_of_heal_wounds" title="Potion of heal wounds">potion of heal wounds</a>. My demigod returns to 24/24 hp.

<p>In the above map, 'g' shows the last known position Ijyb, '@' shows my current position. My best hope is to reach that &gt; before Ijyb kills my demigod. The key sequence will be 'h', 'y', 'k', 'k', 'y, '&gt;'.
</p><p>I press 'h'. In reply, Ijyb reappears.

<p>I should now be in range of Ijyb's wand, but if I press 'y', then Ijyb should have to move again before using the wand. I press 'y'. Ijyb steps southwest. It is well that Ijyb did not step northwest, to take a shortcut toward the stairs.

</pre>
<p>Because Ijyb does not use the shortcut, so my demigod can step north, hopefully without taking hits from Ijyb's wand. I press 'k'. Now Ijyb is not within my demigod's vision. I press 'k' again. Ijyb reappears.

<p>I still need two more moves, 'y' to step onto the stairs and '&gt;' to escape the level. My demigod might receive one or two hits from the wand, but I hope to survive.
</p><p>I press 'y'. <i>Ijyb zaps a wand. The bolt of negative energy hits you! You feel drained. You are now a level 2 Wanderer! Ouch! That really hurt! There is a stone staircase leading down here.</i> That sends me to 7/20 hp, but does my demigod have enough time to use '&gt;' to escape? I press '&gt;'.

<p>My demigod safely arrives on dungeon level 3. I find a <a href="/Kobold" title="Kobold">kobold</a> resting two squares west of my demigod. I hope that with 7/20 hp and with 2 remaining healing potions, I would find a way to defeat this kobold. First I press 'j', hoping to evade the kobold. <i>You hear a shout!</i>
</p><p>I choose to flee south through the corridor, hoping to gain time to regenerate my demigod's hit points. To south, I luckily find a wall segment for my demigod to use as a circuit. When my demigod reaches 20/20 hp, it kills the <a href="/Kobold" title="Kobold">kobold</a> and returns to experience level 3, with 24/24 hp.
</p><p>I have successfully escaped Ijyb. I sometimes hear a rumour that some player, in some roguelike game, comes close to death, quaffs an unidentified potion in desperation, and hopes for healing. Today, my demigod did so.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chatter_3">Chatter</span></h3>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="mlnx.27s_ghost">mlnx's ghost</span></h2>
<p>I press 'm' and disable the practise of all of my demigod's known skills.
</p>
<pre> You have 2 points of unallocated experience.

a - Polearms       Skill  2 (60%)


b - Armour         Skill  1 (70%)
c - Dodging        Skill  1 (65%)
d - Traps &amp; Doors  Skill  1 (70%)
</pre>
<p>When my demigod began this game, I had Armour and Traps &amp; Door skills as shown above. The Polearms and Dodging skills appeared later through practise. These are the only skills in the screen. I hope that my disablement, of all four skills, will save the unallocated experience for the purpose of revealing other skills.
</p><p>Now my demigod explores dungeon level 3, seeking experience. The corridors in this part of the dungeon form a maze. My demigod finds a way north, into parts that are slightly more open.
</p><p>An <a href="/Orc" title="Orc">orc</a>, wearing an orcish chain mail, appears. Behind it is a <a href="/Ghost" class="mw-redirect" title="Ghost">ghost</a>. <i>mlnx's ghost turns its malevolent gaze towards you.</i> This is my first game of Crawl in which I encounter a ghost. I heard that ghosts are dangerous, so I have reasons to fear this ghost.
</p><p>I examine the ghost. <i>The apparition of mlnx the Footpad, a weakling <a href="/Spriggan" title="Spriggan">Spriggan</a> <a href="/Assassin" title="Assassin">Assassin</a>.</i> Because I am in the ##crawl channel at Freenode, I am aware that mlnx was trying to dive level one spriggans as deep as possible. I mention this ghost in the channel, but my discussion mixes with some other discussion, and I am not sure whether this ghost is one of those divers.

<p>The ghost may have enough speed to reach my demigod. I could try to quaff one of my demigod's two <a href="/Potion_of_speed" class="mw-redirect" title="Potion of speed">potions of speed</a>, then flee; but I do not know of any staircase to flee to, except the original staircase that leads back to dungeon level 2 and <a href="/Ijyb" title="Ijyb">Ijyb</a>. Also, the ghost has not actually attacked, so I know not the actual danger.
</p><p>The ghost apparently lacks ranged attacks, because it does not use any while it chases my demigod into the corridor. It comes into melee range.

<p>My demigod attacks first, using the wielded spear. <i>You miss mlnx's ghost. mlnx's ghost hits you.</i> I have 22/24 hp, this battle does not start well. <i>You hit mlnx's ghost. mlnx's ghost is lightly damaged. mlnx's ghost hits you but doesn't do any damage.</i> Now this situation seems better. <i>You miss mlnx's ghost. mlnx's ghost hits you. mlnx's ghost hits you but doesn't do any damage.</i> I have 21/24 hp.

</pre>
<p>My demigod rests. Soon he kills the orc and eats the chunk of orc meat. <i>You feel ill.</i> The <a href="/Sickness" title="Sickness">disease</a> then reduces my demigod's dexterity from 12 to 11. My demigod soon eats a chunk of <a href="/Bat" title="Bat">bat</a> meat, and later eats a chunk from another orc (which does not cause another illness).
</p><p><i>You hit the rat. You have gained Fighting skill! You kill the rat!</i>
</p><p>My inventory fills all available slots, so I instruct my demigod to make a brief trip to dungeon level 2 to dump extra weapons, so that monsters on dungeon level 3 will not take them. Then I finish the exploration of dungeon level 3.
</p><p><i>You have gained Stealth skill!</i> My strategy to gain level one in new skills, by disabling existing skills, seems to work; I now have both <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a> and <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a>.
</p><p>I manage to <a href="/Kiting" title="Kiting">hack-and-back</a> a <a href="/Worm" title="Worm">worm</a>. Soon after this, my demigod reaches "Near Starving" status, because of a recent lack of status. I instruct my demigod to eat a <a href="/Rambutan" title="Rambutan">rambutan</a> from inventory; this upgrades my demigod to "Hungry" status, but it returns to "Very Hungry" status a few turns later. Inventory still has two <a href="/Bread_ration" class="mw-redirect" title="Bread ration">bread rations</a> and one <a href="/Meat_ration" title="Meat ration">meat ration</a>.
</p><p>I dump more weapons to dungeon level 2, then return to dungeon level 3 to try some scrolls and potions. So far, my demigod only knows the <a href="/Wand_of_draining" title="Wand of draining">wand of draining</a> (because of Ijyb), the <a href="/Potion_of_heal_wounds" title="Potion of heal wounds">potion of heal wounds</a> and the <a href="/Potion_of_speed" class="mw-redirect" title="Potion of speed">potion of speed</a>. While writing my last diary (<a href="/Kernigh,_Ice_Elementalist" title="Kernigh, Ice Elementalist">Kernigh, Ice Elementalist</a>) I held to the strategy to collect 2 of each type of item to try one. I probably wanted to avoid trying any rare but very bad item; but when my Ice Elementalist died, I found not much in the identified inventory to fear. This time, I try one of everything.
</p><p>I first try a blue potion. Oops! It is a <a href="/Potion_of_poison" title="Potion of poison">potion of poison</a>. I try to wait for the poison to dissipate. As the meter reaches 10/24 hp, my demigod again becomes "Near Starving", so it eats one of its two <a href="/Bread_ration" class="mw-redirect" title="Bread ration">bread rations</a>. The poison ends before my demigod completely eats the ration. I rest from 9/24 hp to 24/24 hp.
</p><p>Next I try a yellow potion. <i>You feel better.</i> That was <a href="/Potion_of_curing" title="Potion of curing">potion of curing</a>. Now I try reading scrolls. <a href="/Inventory" title="Inventory">Inventory</a> has many individual scrolls; the only stack is 4 scrolls labeled PSUREU LUWNOO.
</p>
<ul><li> XOTTAN ITHRIZXOOGH: <a href="/Scroll_of_curse_armour" title="Scroll of curse armour">scroll of curse armour</a> (My <a href="/Robe" title="Robe">robe</a> glows black; it becomes a cursed +0 robe. Now I need to find the scroll that removes curses.)</li>
<li> MUCLUA HESO: <a href="/Scroll_of_enchant_armour" title="Scroll of enchant armour">scroll of enchant armour</a> (My robe glows green; now it is a +1 robe, so this scroll did remove the curse, but now I cannot identify the other scroll that can remove curses.)</li>
<li> OSUCICUASM: <a href="/Scroll_of_blinking" title="Scroll of blinking">scroll of blinking</a> (My demigod blinks off of the up staircase; then I move to a down staircase.)</li>
<li> ORCHUI GHUIFOSM: <i>Nothing appears to happen.</i></li>
<li> CHAENE SCHAASA: <i>Nothing appears to happen.</i></li>
<li> ISHAINN BIJIBOV: <a href="/Scroll_of_forgetfulness" title="Scroll of forgetfulness">scroll of forgetfulness</a> (<i>You feel momentarily disoriented.</i> The map of this level seems very strange, now that my demigod forgot random parts of it. Fortunately, my demigod does not forget any discovered potions or scrolls; I feared an effect like NetHack's scroll of amnesia.)</li>
<li> SENOTU FYGRONN: <a href="/Scroll_of_detect_curse" title="Scroll of detect curse">scroll of detect curse</a></li>
<li> JUORPHOGOEXT: <a href="/Scroll_of_enchant_weapon_II" class="mw-redirect" title="Scroll of enchant weapon II">scroll of enchant weapon II</a> (My <a href="/Spear" title="Spear">spear</a> glows red; I now have a +0,+1 spear.)</li>
<li> ZEULEC KLIUGH: <a href="/Scroll_of_curse_weapon" title="Scroll of curse weapon">scroll of curse weapon</a> (My spear glows black for a moment, so it is a cursed +0,+1 spear.)</li>
<li> IHEIZAQAER: <a href="/Scroll_of_teleportation" title="Scroll of teleportation">scroll of teleportation</a> (I wait for the teleportation effect, then move to another down staircase.)</li>
<li> INEPSO BLAH: <a href="/Scroll_of_paper" title="Scroll of paper">Scroll of paper</a></li>
<li> PSUREU LUWNOO: <a href="/Scroll_of_identify" title="Scroll of identify">scroll of identify</a> (I only have an elven dagger, some missiles, or some armor to identify. I pick the only unusual item, an uncursed shiny <a href="/Ring_mail" title="Ring mail">ring mail</a>. It is simply a +1 ring mail.)</li></ul>
<p>I know that the armor in my inventory is uncursed, so I instruct my demigod to try each piece of armor. I find that I have a second +1 robe, but my other armor is +0. I remove each armor after I try it, except that my demigod continues to wear my only +0 <a href="/Gloves" title="Gloves">pair of gloves</a>.
</p><p>If my demigod wears a +1 robe and the gloves, then I have AC:4 and EV:10. If it wears the +1 ring mail and the gloves, then I have AC:6 and EV:8. I choose the +1 robe, for the advantage of training <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a>.
</p><p>I now save the game. When I next play Crawl, I will explore dungeon level 4.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chatter_4">Chatter</span></h3>
<p>I feel better about this game, now that I have uncovered more skills and identified many of the scrolls. --<a href="/index.php?title=User:Kernigh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kernigh (page does not exist)">Kernigh</a> 20:55, 2 March 2008 (MST)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fourth_Level.2C_Four_Orcs">Fourth Level, Four Orcs</span></h2>
<p>Today is 9 March 2008. My demigod enters dungeon level 4.
</p><p>While exploring dungeon level 3, I had disabled the practise of most of my demigod's skills. Thus I acquired about 17 unallocated experience points at the dungeon level 3, while gaining level 1 skills in <a href="/Fighting" title="Fighting">Fighting</a> and <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a>. But then I tried those unidentified potions and scrolls, so now my demigod has only one unallocated experience point. I imagine that the scrolls probably helped <a href="/Spellcasting" title="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</a>, while the walking (after my demigod read the <a href="/Scroll_of_teleportation" title="Scroll of teleportation">scroll of teleportation</a>) probably helped <a href="/Stealth" title="Stealth">Stealth</a>.
</p><p>Now that my demigod has a greater variety of skills, I choose to enable the practise of every skill except <a href="/Polearms" title="Polearms">Polearms</a>. I notice that Polearms continues to advance at a slow rate, so I expect to reach level 3 in Polearms; but I do not want Polearms to consume most of my demigod's experience.
</p>
<pre> You have 1 point of unallocated experience.

a + Fighting       Skill  1 (30%)
b - Polearms       Skill  2 (90%)


c + Armour         Skill  1 (70%)

<p>My demigod sees a <a href="/Potion_of_curing" title="Potion of curing">potion of curing</a> on top of something else, two squares east. The problem is, that 's' is a <a href="/Scorpion" title="Scorpion">scorpion</a>, and I would prefer not to be in range of its melee attack. Because the scorpion does not seem to be resting or idle, I assume that it has noticed my demigod. I want to try to damage the scorpion with ranged attacks, then to flee up the stairs. So I check my inventory for missiles.
</p>
<pre>Missiles
 k - 27 elven arrows
 l - a dart
 n - 22 dwarven bolts
 G - 7 curare-tipped needles
 K - 35 stones
</pre>
<p>I do not have a <a href="/Bow" title="Bow">bow</a> to shoot <a href="/Arrow" title="Arrow">arrows</a>, a <a href="/Crossbow" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> to shoot <a href="/Bolt" title="Bolt">bolts</a> or a <a href="/Blowgun" title="Blowgun">blowgun</a> to shoot <a href="/Needle" title="Needle">needles</a>, so my best option is to throw the <a href="/Stone" title="Stone">stones</a>. I am wary that my demigod has no levels in <a href="/Throwing" title="Throwing">Throwing</a>.
</p><p><i>You throw a stone. The stone hits the scorpion. The scorpion is lightly wounded.</i> At least my demigod can do some damage. <i>You throw a stone. The stone misses the scorpion.</i> But the damage may be negligible. <i>You throw a stone. The stone hits the scorpion. The scorpion is lightly wounded.</i> I notice that my demigod has no remaining unallocated experience points. <i>You throw a stone. The stone hits the scorpion. The scorpion is lightly wounded.</i> I wonder how close I am to injuring the scorpion beyond "lightly wounded". <i>You throw a stone. The stone hits the scorpion. The scorpion is lightly wounded.</i> One empty space remains between the scorpion and my demigod (who stands on the stairs), so I flee upstairs.
</p><p>My demigod returns to dungeon level 3. I see another down staircase on the map, but because my demigod previously read a <a href="/Scroll_of_forgetfulness" title="Scroll of forgetfulness">scroll of forgetfulness</a> at this level, it forgot the route to those stairs. I find a way, and my demigod enters another part of dungeon level 4. The large map (presssing 'X') shows that my demigod arrived far to the north-north-west of the area with the scorpion. I explore away from that area, further north. I follow the corridors into an area that contains a staircase toward dungeon level 5. In this area of dungeon level 4, I find a <a href="/Giant_bat" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant bat">giant bat</a>. After my demigod throws only three stones, the giant bat dies.
</p><p>But then something shouts, and my demigod sees the approach of an <a href="/Orc" title="Orc">orc</a>, wielding a glowing orcish <a href="/Mace" title="Mace">mace</a>, and wearin an orcish <a href="/Leather_armour" title="Leather armour">leather armour</a>. The battle begins, and goes well, because the first attacks from that glowing orcish mace all miss or do no damage. Then appears a second orc, wielding an orcish <a href="/Morningstar" title="Morningstar">morningstar</a>. I let the second orc arrive behind the first orc. We continue to fight.
</p><p><i>You hit the orc, but do no damage. The orc is almost dead. The orc hits you with a glowing orcish mace.</i> That mace hits for the first time, damaging my demigod from 24/24 to 18/24 hp. <i>You miss the orc. The orc hits you with a glowing orcish mace.</i> 15/24 hp. A few turns later, my demigod kills the orc. The second orc steps to fight. We do a complete circuit around a wall segment, and my demigod takes the first orc's weapon and armor. <i>The orc hits you with an orcish morningstar.</i> 10/24 hp. I decide to do some circuits to heal.
</p><p>While I do circuits, a third <a href="/Orc" title="Orc">orc</a> appears and shouts! My demigod has 16/24 hp, so I use a turn to attack the second, while hoping that the third orc will move behind the second orc instead of flanking my demigod. My demigod attacks three times; the second orc becomes heavily wounded but my demigod loses 3 hp; then I resume the circuits. The third orc does make one attempt at a flank, but fails and resumes its position behind the second orc. At 24/24 hp, my demigod again attacks. I kill the second orc, but have trouble versus the third orc, who wields a runed orcish <a href="/Short_sword" title="Short sword">short sword</a> and wears an orcish <a href="/Chain_mail" title="Chain mail">chain mail</a>. Turns elapse, circuits happen, hits and misses occur. A fourth orc arrives, wielding an orcish short sword, wearing an orcish leather armour.
</p><p>The fourth orc eventually moves in front. When a <a href="/Giant_gecko" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant gecko">giant gecko</a> appears, I try to flee upstairs. My demigod reaches dungeon level 3, but the fourth orc follows and blocks my demigod's flight.

<p>In this position, I feel that I might need to quaff a <a href="/Potion_of_heal_wounds" title="Potion of heal wounds">potion of heal wounds</a>. However, my demigod kills the fourth orc before that becomes necessary.
</p><p>But I suddenly discover a disadvantage of wielding a cursed weapon. When I press 'D' to remove chunks from the orc corpse, <i>You can't unwield your weapon to draw a new one! Maybe you should try using a sharper implement.</i> I become worried about starvation, though I still have one <a href="/Bread_ration" class="mw-redirect" title="Bread ration">bread ration</a> and one <a href="/Meat_ration" title="Meat ration">meat ration</a> in my inventory. But that is not my major worry.
</p><p>My demigod tries to rest when a <a href="/Kobold" title="Kobold">kobold</a>, wielding a <a href="/Short_sword" title="Short sword">short sword</a> appears. Now my demigod must quaff a potion of heal wounds; it is not a waste if it prevents my game from ending. The potion boosts my demigod from 4/24 to 15/24 hp; but then the kobold misses, and my demigod kills the kobold at next turn. Now I move my demigod to place with more vision and try to rest.
</p><p>But that was not a waste of a potion, because a <a href="/Giant_gecko" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant gecko">giant gecko</a> soon appears. My demigod throws stones at it (and gain level 1 in <a href="/Throwing" title="Throwing">Throwing</a> skill), and defeats it in melee, with 12/24 hp remaining. Now my demigod can rest. <i>You are near starving.</i> It eats a bread ration and rests to 21/24 hp, but it must defeat yet another orc and another giant gecko before it can rest to 24/24 hp.

<p>So my demigod wanderer has some difficulty in fights against common monsters. What do I have left for survive, before my demigod finds the doom of death?
</p>
<pre>Comestibles
 u - a meat ration
Scrolls
 g - 4 scrolls of identify
 X - a scroll of paper
Potions
 d - 2 potions of speed
 o - 2 potions of heal wounds
 N - a potion of poison
</pre>
<p>But my most significant problem is that my demigod wields a cursed +0,+1 spear (because of a <a href="/Scroll_of_curse_weapon" title="Scroll of curse weapon">scroll of curse weapon</a>); thus my demigod may never switch to a dagger and remove chunks of meat from corpses. It is one <a href="/Meat_ration" title="Meat ration">meat ration</a> away from starvation.
</p><p>I am currently at dungeon level 3, where my demigod previously explored (though my map is now incomplete because of a <a href="/Scroll_of_forgetfulness" title="Scroll of forgetfulness">scroll of forgetfulness</a>). I want to find a scroll that would uncurse my demigod's spear, so I need to explore deeper. My demigod has fought battles in dungeon level 4 but retreated here to rest. I know of three downward staircases that would return me to dungeon level 4. The first staircase leads toward the orc with the runed orcish <a href="/Short_sword" title="Short sword">short sword</a>; the second staircase leads toward a scorpion, so I take the third staircase.
</p><p>I explore dungeon level 4, and find the <a href="/Scorpion" title="Scorpion">scorpion</a> again. I would like to stop worrying about it. Maybe I can kill it in melee, but first I throw stones at it. The melee commences, and seems to confirm my fear of the scorpion. As the scorpion ands its poison reduce my demigod to 6/24 hp, I quaff a <a href="/Potion_of_heal_wounds" title="Potion of heal wounds">potion of heal wounds</a>. Unfortunately that does not help much... <i>* * * LOW HITPOINT WARNING * * *</i> 1/24 hp.
</p><p>This is the desperate last stand, and almost certainly the end of the game. I quaff the last potion of heal wounds, quaff a potion of speed and run for a nearby down staircase... but while I escaped the scorpion, the poison will kill my demigod. I may only watch while my demigod rests in vain.
</p><p>I understand now that I should quaff a potion of speed before I fight a scorpion!

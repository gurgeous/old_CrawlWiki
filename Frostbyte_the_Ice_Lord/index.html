<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Beginning.2C_again:">The Beginning, again:</span></h2>
<p>D1:
I have taken to wandering the upper dungeon as I know so well, slaughtering the weak vermin that live in the crevasses, feeding my power. Already I have learned to throw frost once again, and I am exhilarated at the power contained in the elf. Vehumet has treated me well.
</p><p><br />
D2:
The hobgoblins have bred in the years of my absence! I was hunted through corridors until I turned to fight them, stealing their heat and freezing their bones so they died in their tracks. More power. Another spell. Ozocubu's Armor is such a useful one...too bad I had to kill the old fool before he created more spells of ice. We can't have anyone growing more powerful than the Ice Lord, can we?
</p><p>Jessica! Her magical darts were aimed poorly and only three bursts of frost were required to dispatch her. I was struck only by one dart, but it only made her flesh taste that much better. Her robe was slightly enchanted as well. Did I say HER robe? I meant MY robe.
</p><p>What's this? Some strange shrine has been build into the dungeon wall. I enter, cautiously, through the hall until I notice a small door at the end. I open it, half expecting treasure or another band of hobgoblins, and lo and behold there is an alter. To Sif Muna no less. How quaint. She is a vain god, only concerned with learning, not unleashing to true power spells behold. I freeze the alter before slamming the door on the pagan shrine.
</p><p>D3:
A snake presented some trouble, poisoning the poor elf's body, but it was only minor, and it was dispatched with ease. There were a few goodies lying around: Meat, gold, scrolls, potions, and it almost seems as if the snake was hording them. Strange.
</p><p>A sludge elf earth elementalist's ghost! The pale visage advanced but never cast spells, falling after receiving a few well-placed frost spells. The ghost muttered it's name just before it's destruction: "Tectonic." I have not had pleasant experiences with ghosts, especially the ones whose bodies I once inhabited. I shiver at the memory of their hatred and torment, and move on. There is much to destroy.
</p><p>D4:
Finally! The temple! I almost trip in anticipation, ignoring the sleeping creatures all around me as I hurry down the stairs, searching for the altar of Vehumet. Soon, I found it, praying to Vehumet, thanking him for my new form, and asking for his gifts. He recognizes my voice, but he will not award me until I prove that this body can finish the task. I must retrieve the orb. It is the only way to be released from this accursed dungeon, to wreak havoc on the surface-dwellers! Vehumet's destruction will spread across the world, as the Hells freeze over! I stand motionless, giddy with anticipation. I pray one last time to Vehumet, and return to the dungeon, the consciousness of a god on my shoulders.
</p><p>I wander through the corridors, blasting every living (and undead, although I have not found any yet) creature within sight. Soon, I had wandered upon a shop! Good. I bought several items to be identified: A scroll of curse armor, a scroll of immolation, and a scroll of identify. Wonderful.
</p><p>On my way back from the shop, I notice the fountains by the temple are sparkling, flowing with an ancient magic. I must not have noticed it in my rush to greet Vehumet, but now I crave the magical water, and I drink deep and long from the fountains, lifting my head only after I felt the waters changing my very being. The world seemed slightly blurry, and I could not clear the sensation from my eyes. Not good. Then I noticed how much stronger I felt. So much more...robust. 20% more robust, to be in fact. Good. I move on, content with my find.
</p><p>D5:
Oh no! A centaur! And an orcish priest! I cannot fight them with the power I currently posses! I flee up the stairs, arrows thumping into my back, blood gushing on the steps as I falter at the top, collapsing into a pile of oozing, sticky blood. But I am alive. I drink a potion to cure the immediate injuries, and rest, thanking Vehumet that I am still alive. I go to another set of stairs and creep down, cautiously.
</p><p>Again, the orc is there! This time with a wizard! I dispatch them both with an Ice Bolt each, and look around for that accursed centaur, but he is nowhere to be found. I continue to creep along the walls, and as I round an outcropping I see the centaur, bow notched and aimed right at my head! I duck just in time for the arrow to whiz by, and I leap forwards, towards the beast, but it shys away, trying in vain to let go of it's bow so it can fight. I laugh. The monster had a cursed bow. How amusing. It died frozen to the wall with the bow still attached to its dead hands.
</p><p>More dungeon, more monsters. The only noteworthy events were: the quick killing of another centaur, a book, and a bug fight. The centaur is hardly worth mentioning, and his corpse, pinned to the wall by a spear of ice, is even less noteworthy, but the book was much more interesting. It had a teal-green cover, and upon opening it I was fire spells. How barbaric. I threw the book aside and continued on, until I was pinned on either side by an ant and a scorpion. In a panic, I zapped the ant with my wand, and it turned against the scorpion, mandibles clenching on the tail! A wand of enslavement! What luck! The scorpion tore the ant's head clean off, so I zapped it was well, ordering it to wander around as I made my escape. Smooth. This floor is clear, and there are a few more levels to go before I report back here. May Vehumet guild you to the destruction of others.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Hordes_Cometh:">The Hordes Cometh:</span></h2>
<p>D8:
I continued my rain of destruction for just a little while longer until I heard what sounded like gibbering kobolds. Eager for the easy targets
they presented, I charged down a hallway at one poor sap, freezing him in midspeech where he stood. Suddenly, the dungeon went quiet. Not an echo,
not a scurry, not a noise. I turn to look down the doorway where he came from and froze myself, as the twenty or so Kobolds and big Kobolds stared back, then they screamed a bloodthirsy battlecry and charged forwards, all of them! I turned, ran for the stairs, the Kobolds right behind me when I had an idea.
I turned around at the end of the hall, zapping one of my wands at the closest kobold, and was exstatic to see a bolt of lightning shoot through him and the horde behind him, bouncing on a wall and coming back, shocking them again.
I felt the glee of slaughter again as I struck them with the bolts again and again and again, until the last few kobolds stood among their sizzling brethren, only to be skewered on ice bolts like chunks of meat. I dropped the wand, empty of charges, and laughed, Vehumet laughing beside me. I felt his pleasure and his gifts were bestowed upon me in haste.
It has begun. The Ice Lord has returned.
Exhilarated by my victory, I sped throught the rest of that dungon level, delivering an icy death to everything, EVERYTHING, that stood in my path. After much slaughter, I realized that something was amiss.
Slurp.
A jelly?
Slurp.
Slurp.
Slurp x 10.
NO! The Kobold army's weapons and armor! The jelly was  creating a horde of it's own! I ran back to the kobold corpes to find nothing -NOTHING- left.
In my fury I shouted and cursed, and a jelly appeared at the far end of the hallway, slurping towards me. I fired and Ice Bolt at it, splitting the thing in half, and I watched as the halves wriggeled.
Another jelly rounded the corner. And another. And another. Soon there were at least ten Jellies, and I fought fiercely, tearing them apart, freezing them, battering them with ice and cold until, at last, they all were dead.
By this time I had gained power, and a lot of it. I reveled in my newfound abilities, slaying Sigmund with little but a thought, taking his robe for my own (+2), cutting him up with his own sythe, and eating what was left.
I preceded down the stairs, victorious. But again I heard chattering. It was far too gutteral to be Kobold, so I assumed it must be orcish, and I rounded another corner to find another horde.
</p><p>D9:
The fight was brutal, grueling, and painful for both sides, but I emerged the victor, using their own warriors against them by enslaving them with my wand. Their kills fed my energy, and orc after orc fell until the room was silent.
But not entirely silent. Still, far off, I heard more gutteral noises. "Survivors," I had thought foolishly, and I ran ahead, making much noise until I saw ANOTHER orcish army.
The orcs must have not forgotten me and my raids on their mines, long, long ago, and they fought ferociously again, but a new wand of cold proved to be quite effective against the horde.
Another horde was dead, and again I felt the surge of strength, and I went forward again, to more orcish noises to yet another horde. This one provided no threat whatsoever, and their corpses were flavored with sweet victory.
On I forged, until I came upon a break in the dungeon wall. An opening loomed, large and ominous, and I went inside to find lizards. Large, large, lizards. Komodo dragons, steam dragons, giant lizards, and giant iguanas all swarmed from the crevasse, and they were all met with icy blasts and screams of cold rage.
I stepped gingerly throught the fallen corpses to see a gaping hole in the floor, animal noises and oozing filth rose from the hole in a steam, and I took a deep breath, and headed in.
</p><p>My power is increasing. I can feel Vehumet's pride and ice in my veins as I stride forward, destruction filling my mind. This lair will prove no more difficult than fighting an angry child.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Lair:">The Lair:</span></h2>
<p>My prediction soon came true, and I was tearing throught the lair with no opposition. Not even hydras dare came within my range of sight, and as soon as they did, icy blasts sent them scurrying away, only to be pinned to a wall by an icy spear, sliding down the rough walls as it melted.
As I destroyed the lair, Vehumet's prescence grew, and he soon showered me with gifts of spellbooks and abilities. I learned Bolt of Cold, repel missiles, and detect traps from miscillanious spellbooks, and in no time I could feel sheets of ice sliding off me with a clink onto the stone below me, frost springing up in my footsteps and death in my eyes.
</p><p>I'm back.
</p><p>After reading a few scrolls I was given an abomination. I decided to name it "Hulk," and it took to the name with vigor, smashing creatures not worth my attention, like rats or dogs.
However, after testing potions, I drank a potion of confusion, and I slapped Hulk in the process, angering the little thing. As soon as I had my wits about me I froze the abomination, but I miss Hulk.
A scroll of aquirement gave me a staff of cold, and sheer luck granted me a staff of energy, allowing me to switch between the two when casting spells.
A bazaar sold me a wand of healing, and I now felt invincible. My power was growing and growing, and the creatures of the dungeon outside were beginning to utter my name with dreaded aniticipation.
I'm heading back to the dungeon to slaughter a few innocents before preceding to the Swamps, where the first rune awaits me like it has so many times before.
I wish there were more to report, but the lair contained little but easy prey.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Swamps:">The Swamps:</span></h2>
<p>S1:
After killing a few hapless monsters I barged into the Swamps, splashing around as if I owned the place. Could I not see that it's inhabitants had been given hundreds of years to recuperate from my last siege? I felt invincible after all this body had gone through, but that feeling vanished as a swamp worm sprung from the water to sink it's teeth into my torso, nearly ripping me apart. I barely killed it with a bolt of cold, and had I not frozen the monster immediately I would be just another set of bones in the shallows.
The mortality of this body struck me, and I steered clear from the water and murk, only stepping in after blasting every living creature in sight, and even then I tread cautiously.
I happened across a lava flow, boiling it's way through the swamps, and I killed it's residents. It was like shooting lava worms in a bauxite barrel.
With this floor clear, I continued downwards.
</p><p>S2:
The second floor was much like the first: Lots of water, worms, and hydras. Nothing special.
</p><p>S3:
As I was wandering the third floor, after shooting a few worms in the water, Vehumet decided to grant me his final book: Demonology. I stared at the book for some time, thinking, remembering. I had, before, learned from the book out of sheer curiosity, only to find out that the demons are not forever bound to you. I still remember the lightning ripping through me as I had died, and I did not want to repeat that experience. I almost through the book into the water, but refrained for no reason other than Abjuration, which the book contains. I have left it on the floor for now.
</p><p>Ah! A scroll of vorpalize weapon! I briefly considered vorpalizing my hands, but I doubted that it would have any effect, and I ended up dropping the sroll. Oh well. Maybe some day I will be able to turn my bare hands into ripping machines without the help of a spell. I'll still to shooting things instead, anyways.
</p><p>S4: There have always been a few things that I will forever remember, life after life. The crunch of frozen hydra flesh is not a good memory.
</p><p>S5: The final floor, if I remembered correctly. I used a scroll of magical mapping to find then den of hydras and dragons. Where they were, the run would be. I crept silently to the entrance, drank a potion of invisibility, and turned the entire den into a swirling vortex of ice and sleet. I repeated the spell until I could barely see through the blizzard, and all about me I could hear the screams of pain and the thudding of bodies to the floor. They did not see me, could not sense me, and they could only wander around in the vortex until the ice claimed their lives and robbed them of their warmth. When the storm had settled and the last dragons had fallen, I looked inside to see the chamber. The walls were smooth, as if they had been sand blasted (that must have been from the storm) and the torn carcasses of the dragons and hydras littered the floor like heavy, dead dolls. I made my way to the back of the room and picked up the glowing rune, elated to feel it's power once again.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Snake_Pits">The Snake Pits</span></h2>
<p>P1: The snake pits are a unique venture for me every time. While the screams of pain and agony remain as they were one hundred years ago, the Pit seems to twist and...slither... through the years. That being said, there were long hallways, begging to have lethal bolts of ice hurled down them upon unsuspecting foes, and I began to enjoy myself, seeing how many nagas I could coax into stepping into storms of ice and sleet.
</p><p>P2-P4:
Slaughter.
</p><p>P5:
Here came the tricky part. I knew the greater nagas were no easy prey. Filled with vile venom spells, usually hasted and having enormous amounts of health, I knew I had to kill them either one-by-one or all at once.
I decided to use a spell that I had learned earlier: Ozucubu's Refridgeration. Since this spell is widely unused, I will tell you what it does. It freezes the very air. Yes, as far as you can see, the air (and creatures) are frozen, their heat slain from their very bodies. And the best part? They won't even wake up. Knowing this, I crept quietly down the stairs, putting on protectors from the cold: rings, my staff, and cold resistant armor. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, I looked around in the gloom and saw nagas, row after row of them, resting in their ceremonial guard formations. I silently rested the butt of my staff on the floor, and sucked the heat from the room. They froze, silently and without notice, one after the other, their corpses falling into crunching heaps on the floor. Vehumet, greatly pleased with my choice of spell, granted me magic over and over, fueling my rapid theft of life and warmth. Soon, not a single naga stood, each dead on the floor, clutching their weapons with their eyes shut, as if in peaceful sleep. And there, in the back of the room, was another rune. The shifting serpentine pattern flowed across it's face, and I picked it up and regressed back to the dungeon, leaving in my wake an icy tomb.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Dungeon">The Dungeon</span></h2>
<p>The time had come for me to re-own what was once mine! I burst from the Lair, icy burst flying, and I tore my way through the dungeon, devastating the inhabitants with a vicious vengeance! How they screamed! The dungeon walls were stained with nevermelting ice, the corpses preserved under thick sheets like flies in amber, and I had no mercy. Not a soul stood in my way, and I destroyed everything all the way down to the twenty-seventh floor. I only stopped when the shifting purple gate of Zot halted my progress. I gazed at the gateway, and I could feel the orb calling to me, promising my release, begging to be freed as well, hinting at the wonderful consequences of freedom. I remembered that I needed a third rune, and, with a bit of longing, headed up the dungeon to the iron gate of the Vaults.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Vaults">The Vaults</span></h2>
<p>V1-V7: 
The creatures of the vault were as cold and hard as the metal walls themselves, and half as pleasant to look at. Yaktaurs, stone giants, endless zombies and skeletons, and slime creatures plagued me. My energies were consumed several times without eliminating the attacking hordes, and I was forced to retreat up the stairs each time, regenerating my magical energies before enchanting myself and tearing through the monsters below me. As for equipment, nothing was found. Nothing. A scroll of aquirement provided only a ring of levitation (my fourth one), and I dropped it in disgust. Hopefully I will be given something useful next time I use one of those scrolls.
</p><p>V8:
Again, here came the tricky part. The vaults were moderately difficult, but the final floor of the vaults was far more difficult than many branches of the dungeon combined. There were dragons of all sorts, even the rare Shadow Dragons, it had titans, hundreds of stone giants, and even more Yaktaurs. I knew this place to be deadly and dangerous. But even more dangerous for the unprepared were the guards. They themselves were a challenge to kill, with at least twenty or so surrounding the stairs, but even deadlier are their shouts of pain or surprise. Their cries can bring all kinds of horrible creatures from across the floor, and defeating them takes time, skill, and a whole lot of luck. I was determined to make sure they would never make a sound. Invisible again, I crept down the stairs, and, like in the Snake Pits, I froze them all in their sleep. Perfect. I swiftly entered the most secure vault, full of large, square rooms and wonderfully long hallways(did I mention that I enjoy hallways?), it also contained the most loot and prizes. I went down the long, two-wide corridor to the first treasure room and saw a horde of giants and yaktuars, with a titan and shadow dragon in the back. Luckily, in the front, were freezing wraiths, and the creatures behind them didn't want to shoot past them into me, so I froze the hallway with Refrigeration, killing all but the dragon and wraiths. Vehumet's satisfaction and magical energy empowered me enough to Ice Bolt the wraiths and dragon down without being touched, and I looted the rooms, stealing their treasures. Next came the grid of steel, full of giants. I had found a book of Divinations in the treasure vaults, and I learned several spells before proceeding, the first being detect creatures. Each giant in the grid was snuck up upon, and I stole their heat, killing them in their sleep like the guards. There was no treasure, and, unfortunately, no rune. I continued on to the third vault, shaped like a square doughnut, and retrieved it's treasure and killed it's guardians as well. Nothing interesting, but even worse, no rune. The last vault awaited me, it's giant vaulting ceilings echoing my footsteps through the large open space. I had died here once before. It was not a pretty death. I hugged the left wall, creeping like vermin along the smooth metal surface, engravings of the countless deaths of thieves periodically scraping along my back, until I saw the first corner. There was nothing guarding the gold and ring there, so I helped myself to them and moved along, creeping and creeping until I saw the first guardian. It was a stone giant, and he froze quickly, but not quick enough. He woke up, blinking frost form his eyelids, screaming in pain and fury, and it hurled a boulder at me before succumbing to the cold. Soon, the rest of the guards burst from the shadows, and I shrieked in terror. A lich. The very same that had killed me, and he had bred himself some dragon guards, a shadow dragon and storm dragon, each very unhappy to see me. I hasted myself and ran, screaming, to the stairwell, where I regained some of my courage and turned to face the first dragon, prepared to flee up the stairs at a moment's notice, and my first volley of ice bolts only moderatly wounded the shadow dragon. It shot a bolt of draining at me, and I dodged, firing several more bolts until the thing died on the cold floor. Next came the storm dragon, and soon it was lying beside the shadow dragon, huge bolts of ice sticking from it's back and chest. I felt drained, and fled up the stairs to recover my magic. Hasting and enchanting myself, I hesitantly stepped down the stairs to fight the lich. When I reached the bottom, he was not there. Odd. I took a step towards the large metal room. Nothing. Another step. Nothing. Another step. With a scream of hatred, the lich flung itself from behind the metal walls, firing an iron bolt at me that I barely dodged, the thick metal spear thumping into the soft iron wall behind me, and I unloaded everything I had on the lich. Bolts, coulds, and icy spells flew every which way, and the lich had only the time to try and turn invisible to run before the final spell shattered his bones. I stood, panting over the undead corpse, and I laughed. Crazed, raucous laughter reverberating off the harsh metal walls, and I strode forward to the rune, wedge in the corner at the far end of the room, and I took it, power and victory filling my mind like a drug. Power is such a wonderful thing.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Slime_Pits">The Slime Pits</span></h2>
<p>M1:
As much as I would have loved to dash into Zot and retrieve my Orb, I knew I did not have the power to do so. There was much to be gained before I reached my maximum potential, but I felt I was close. I remembered an ancient city of slime that was crumbling at the time of my last death, so I traveled there to kill the slimes without their organized resistance. On the first floor I found a book. A book of practical magic. Wonderful. I learned Selective amnesia and removed several spells that were clogging my memory. With all the space open for learning, I learned my ancient spell of destruction: Ice Storm. Giddy to use it once again, I stormed my way through the slime pits, all the way to floor 6.
</p><p>M6: The slime citadel still stood, so I decided to be a little more careful when attacking this time. I used Bolt of Cold for it's silent killing power, and I snuck as close as I could to the Royal Jelly, still encased in the ancient stone structure. As soon as I could see it, I hasted myself and froze it in it's sleep until it awakened, and I fled outside the citadel and awaited it's blind charge. And charge it did, popping from the corridors with a slurping noise, and it was met with and ice storm, ripping it apart and destroying the slimes it created instantly. Once more Ice Storm and it was dead, and in a blinding flash of light the citadel turned into glass, revealing the ancient treasures of the slime city, encased from the mindless jellies that roamed the Pits now. I disintigrated a single glass wall for each corner of the citadel, and reaped the rewards with fabulous jewelry, armor, scrolls, and artifacts. I was strong, but I knew I still wasn't strong enough.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Hall_of_Blades">The Hall of Blades</span></h2>
<p>B1: 
The Halls were a shooting gallery. Ice Storm made so much noise that every dancing weapon from all around came to the sound, and none were able to survive one Ice Storm, and Vehumet fueled my magic, so eliminating every dancing weapon was a simple task. I left the halls, close to the power I knew was necessary. The final peak of power that a single body can hold.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Crypt">The Crypt</span></h2>
<p>C1-5: 
I have never been fond of the Crypt, and I am beginning to believe that the creatures of the Crypt spawn from the very walls themselves. Nevertheless, liches were simple to kill with Ice Storm, much less minor skeletons or zombies.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Zot">Zot</span></h2>
<p>Z1:
I was ready. I felt prepared. I had become quite adapt at Divinations, and everything in an entire floor could be revealed to me with but a thought. I boldly entered the gate and blinked in the dim colored glow of the walls. It was strange. I had never been within the realm of a god before, and the dragon god Zot was a strange one at that. Draconians and dragons populated the corridors, dispatched with two ice storms at the most. With my newfound third eye, I could kill many of them before they rounded a corridor to see me. It was a simple task killing the beasts, and even easier to kill electricity golems, who died with just one storm. I was taking no chances.
</p><p>Z2:
More draconians. I accidentally hit myself with one of my own storms, nearly killing me instantly. My wand of healing was able to save my life, but the scars will forever remain. I will be sure to never hit myself with this spell ever again.
</p><p>Z3: 
Dragons, draconians and golems. It is becoming a normal (but tedious) cycle. Kill, eat, kill some more. One wonderful thing happened that was exceptionally lucky, to break my cycle. A white draconian normally receives minimal damage from the ice part of an ice storm, but this one seemed to be taking none at all from the elements, taking a full three storms to finally bring down. Curious, I examined his robe and found it to be a +2 robe of resistance! Perfect! I now resist the elements in their entirety. For good measure, I enchanted it to +3.
</p><p>Z4: 
I have finally mastered spellcasting. Ice Magic, Conjurations, and Spellcasting are normally my specialties, but now they are my art form. I can cast many, many spells without hungering whatsoever, and only ice storm makes my tummy rumble after long chains of casting. I am one with ice and magic, a being infused of raw power and energies, and I am showing through the elf's body, shedding it like a husk. It is time.
</p><p>Z5:
I strode into the antechamber, blasting the guardians out of the air with bolts of cold. I detected every trap, every monster, every nook and cranny that the dungeon had to offer, and I could see them all. All those usurpers of my Orb, guarding it jealously because they themselves cannot use it or are bound to protect it, every one was within sight of my third eye. The second chamber, the one to the right, contained only a dragon, which was also dispatched with a bolt of cold. Not a noise had been made, not yet. The weaklings seemed to be hiding, cowering in the darkest corner, and as soon as I knew they were just out of sight range, I sent such a massive wave of icy explosions that Cocytus itself looked tame, even the great demon lords themselves would have look on with pity at the sheer magnitude of the blizzard that was fired at them. Orbs of fire, ancient liches, electricity golems,  Xtahua, and ancient ghosts of powerful explorers were torn to unregocnizable shreds as the storm ripped through them, boring a massive hole in the wall, leaving nothing but water and blood on the floor. I resisted the urge to laugh like I had over the corpse of the lich, and I turned to see it...the orb...shining and glistening on the shifting purple floor, the golden casing writhing like a hundred snakes as I picked it up, and let the laugh out of me as the demons rose from the floor. The demons were fast, but I was faster, hasted and fleeing up the stairs before they could take a swipe at me.
I ran like hell, ran as if the ground was trying to eat my itself(I'm sure it was).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Escape">Escape</span></h2>
<p>Z4: Up to Zot 4, and I kept going, up and up and up, only encountering a tentacled monstrosity on the way.
Z3: A demon lord of Pandemonium rose from the floor before me, only to be torn apart by two ice storms. I ran straight through the icy crystals, taking no heed to the cold.
Z2: Assyqur the pandemonium lord! RUN! Faster and faster I ran, wishing the elf was stronger.
Z1: A draconian! KILL!
D27:I could feel the orb's power taking hold of me! I felt the freedom! I felt I could shed the enchantment binding me to this place and escape!
D26:Paqy the pandemonium lord blocks my path! NO! I haste myself and kill the thing before it has a chance to move, my storm tore through the dungeon, disintigrating the demons in it's path, and I ran through it's wake, up to the next flight of stairs!
D25-23: The demons are were much more cautious after seeing one of their lords die so horribly, and they seemed to hold back, waiting, watching.
D22: I was almost to the next flight of stairs when the ground opened up before me and belched out Kha Saod the pandemonium lord, and it threw a firestorm at me, destroying my icy shields! I was nearly dead! If it were not for my robe I would have surely died. Firing storms back at the demon until it was dead, I hurried on, casting regeneration on myself to heal as I ran.
D21-3: Faster and faster I tore through the dungeon, lungs burning, legs on fire, and I was almost there!
D2: NO! Another demon lord! Thrud the pandemonium lord hit me with a storm, and I bolted down a corridor, and up the set of stairs to the first floor.
D1: This is it! I disintegrate my way to the final set of stairs and escape to the world above, free to destroy in the name of Vehumet. All fear the Ice Lord! I have arisen!
